<h2><span class="h2line1">PREFACE.</span></h2>
<p>In the following pages I have endeavored to sketch, in
rather bold outlines, the story of Texas. It is a story of
knightly romance which calls the poet even as, in earlier days,
the Land of the Tehas called across its borders the dreamers
of dreams.</p>
<p>But the history of Texas is far more than a romantic legend.
It is a record of bold conceptions and bolder deeds; the story
of the discoverer penetrating unknown wildernesses; of the
pioneer matching his strength against the savage; of the colonist
struggling for his freedom and his rights.</p>
<p>It is the chronicle of the birth of a people; the history of
the rise and progress of a great State.</p>
<p>I have tried in these simple readings so to arrange the
salient points of a drama of two centuries as to present a
consistent whole.</p>
<p>And I shall be happy if I shall succeed in awakening in the
reader somewhat of the interest in Texas history which has
inspired this work.</p>
<p>There are several features which mark Texas history as
unique. One of these is the difference between the methods
of colonization employed in Texas and those exercised elsewhere
in the United States.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>The pioneer with his cabin, his ever-spreading fields, his
gardens and orchards&mdash;the idea of the home with its roots in
the very soil, as represented by Austin and his followers&mdash;was
preceded by a hundred barren years of fortress and soldier,
the Spanish idea of conquest and military rule.</p>
<p>Again, its vast extent of territory and the ease with which
its rich lands were acquired seemed to adapt Texas peculiarly
to those communistic and utopian experiments which have
been the delight of the visionary in every age of the world&rsquo;s
progress. A number of these have been tried upon its soil.
The result has been to give a varied and original coloring to
the shifting scenes.</p>
<p>The philosophical student will find these phases of our history
well worth his consideration.</p>
<p class="tb">I desire in this place to express my thanks to the Texas
teachers, to many of whom I am indebted for timely suggestions
and for kindly encouragement; also my grateful obligation
to Mr. William Beer, of the New Orleans Howard Memorial
Library, for valuable assistance; and to the Library itself,
which, under his able direction, has become particularly rich
in documents and publications relating to the early history
of Louisiana and Texas.

<h3 id="c1">1. IN THE NAME OF FRANCE.</h3>
<p>One morning early in the year 1684, Robert Cavalier, Sieur
de la Salle, a gentleman in the King&rsquo;s service, stood waiting in
an antechamber of the royal palace at Versailles (Ver-s&#257;lz&prime;).
Behind the closed door, which was guarded by two of the
King&rsquo;s Musketeers in their showy uniforms, his Majesty
Louis the Fourteenth was giving a private audience to the
Count de Frontenac. This gentleman, late the governor of
New France (Canada), was the friend and adviser of <i>The
Adventurer</i>, as La Salle had been mockingly nicknamed by the
idlers of the French court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>La Salle, who was headstrong and somewhat overbearing in
character, more used, moreover, to command than to obey,
frowned as he walked up and down the room, and glanced
impatiently from time to time towards the king&rsquo;s cabinet,
where his fate hung in the balance. Months had passed since
he had arrived in France from North America, with a great
scheme already planned, and lacking only the consent of the
king and his ministers. He had danced attendance at court
until he was weary, rugged soldier that he was; now filled with
hope when the ministers plied him with false promises, now
sunk in despair when his enemies placed obstacles in his way.
&ldquo;Would I were back in the wilds of America, with Tonti of
the Iron Hand and my red brothers,&rdquo; he muttered, downcast
and discouraged.</p>
<p>But at length the door opened, the tapestry was pushed
aside, and Frontenac appeared. His eyes beamed with satisfaction.
&ldquo;Your application is granted,&rdquo; he said, pressing
La Salle&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;His
Majesty commissions you
to plant a colony at the
mouth of the great river
where you have already
raised the flag of France.
Go, my friend; thank his
gracious Majesty, and then
hasten your preparations
for departure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="574" />
<p class="caption">La Salle.</p>
</div>
<p>La Salle lost no time in
obeying these directions.
His heart throbbed with
pride and satisfied ambition.
For this was his
dream: to colonize the beautiful wilderness watered by the
lower Mississippi; to found a city on the banks of the mighty
stream whose mouth it had been his good fortune to discover.</p>
<p>But this dream was never to be realized by him. It was the
destiny of La Salle not to colonize Louisiana, but to become
the discoverer of Texas.</p>
<p>After much trouble La Salle succeeded in perfecting the
arrangements for his voyage. His little fleet was composed of
four vessels: the <i>Aimable</i> (&#256;-mah&prime;-bl), the <i>Joli</i> (Zho-le&eacute;), the
<i>Belle</i>, and the <i>St. Francis</i>. In these embarked over three
hundred souls, including women, workmen, priests, and soldiers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>They sailed from Rochelle, France, on the 24th of July,
1684. The passage across the Atlantic was tedious and
stormy; it was embittered by constant quarrels between La
Salle and Beaujeu (Bo-zhuh&prime;), the naval commandant of the
squadron; and the fleet was crippled by the loss of the
<i>St. Francis</i>, the store-ship, which was captured by the Spaniards.
But toward the end of September the remaining vessels,
in tolerable condition, entered the Gulf of Mexico. Here
La Salle began a sharp lookout for the wide mouth of the
river he aimed to enter.</p>
<p>He was full of confidence in himself, for he had spent years
of his life tracking the savage wilderness of the north with his
Indian guides, and he had the keen eye and the ready memory
of the practiced scout.</p>
<p>But he had no exact chart of the pathless and unknown
waters around him; the calculation of the experienced landsman
stood him in little stead
at sea. He lost his way, and
sailing to the westward of the
river known to us as the Mississippi,&mdash;but
called by La
Salle the St. Louis,&mdash;he came,
on the 1st of January, 1685,
in sight of the low-lying shores
of Texas.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p02a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="449" />
<p class="caption">The Flag of France.</p>
</div>
<p>Some weeks later, the fleet
anchored in the Gulf outside
the beautiful land-locked bay of San Bernard (now Matagorda
Bay); and La Salle, flag in hand, and attended by soldiers
and priests, set foot on the new land, taking formal possession
of it in the name of the King of France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>To the colonists, so long confined within the small ships
and overwearied by the monotony of the voyage, it was a joy
simply to feast their eyes on the green of the trees that lined
the shore, and to breathe the fresh air that blew down, flower-scented,
from the far western prairies. They longed to run
like children on the sandy beach, to feel under their feet the
firm turf. But La Salle&rsquo;s experience among the Indians had
taught him caution. He took the utmost care in landing his
colonists, and in forming his temporary camps. Two temporary
camps were established, one on Matagorda Island, where
the lighthouse now stands; the other on the mainland, near
the present site of Indianola.</p>
<p>His own heart, meantime, was heavy. He had missed his
coveted and beloved river, though he still believed that the
San Bernard Bay might be one of its mouths. The <i>Aimable</i>,
in attempting to enter the harbor, had grounded upon a sandbank
and gone to pieces. The Indians, who had swarmed to
the coast in great numbers to greet the pale-faced strangers,
had already become troublesome. They had, indeed, murdered
two of the colonists, named Ory and Desloges. This was the
first European blood shed upon Texas soil. The stock of
provisions was running low, and finally, to crown all, Beaujeu,
from the beginning hostile to La Salle, had hoisted sail, with
scant warning, and returned to France, leaving the eight cannons
and the powder belonging to the expedition, but carrying
away with him all the cannon balls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>A less sturdy spirit might have been wholly disheartened;
but La Salle, whatever he felt, gave no signs of weakness. He
explored the country round about, and at the end of a short
time he marked out the foundation of a fort beside a small
stream which empties into the bay. He called the river <i>Les
Vaches</i> (Cow River<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>), from the number of buffaloes which
grazed along the banks. The spot<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> chosen for the site of the
fort was a delightful one; the rolling prairies which stretched
away northward were covered with rich grass and studded
with belts of noble timber; southward lay the grey and misty
line of the bay; birds of gay plumage sang in shadow of the
grapevines that trailed from overhanging trees to the water&rsquo;s
edge; the clear stream reflected the blue and cloudless sky of
southern Texas. Here the colonists set to work. La Salle
with his own hands aided in hewing and laying the heavy
beams of wall and of blockhouse. The curious savages, tall
Lipans and scowling Carankawaes, hung about the place, peering
forward with jealous eyes, and picking off the unwary
workmen with their deadly arrows. But a day came at last
when the little fortress, with its chapel, lodgings, and guardhouse,
was completed. Amid the cheers of the colonists the
flag of France loosened its folds to the wind; a hymn of
thanksgiving and praise arose from the chapel; and La Salle,
giving to the fort the name of St. Louis, dedicated it to France
in the name of the King.</p>
<p>Several expeditions followed, in 1685 and 1686, the building
of Fort St. Louis. La Salle not only cherished the hope of
finding his lost river; he was lured northwestward by rumors
obtained from the Cenis, the Nassonites, and other friendly
Indians, of rich silver mines in the interior. He wished also
to communicate, if possible, with his old friend, the Chevalier
Tonti of the Iron Hand, whom he had left with a colony on
the Illinois River. Tonti, having lost a hand in battle, used
one made of iron; hence his title.</p>
<p>These journeys were both painful and perilous; the footsore
explorers were obliged to swim swollen rivers; they
traversed dangerous swamps and unknown forests; they
encountered and fought with hostile Indians; they suffered
the pangs of hunger and thirst; they were shaken with chills
and parched with fever. It is marvelous, indeed, that a spark
of courage should have remained in their hearts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>On returning to the fort after one of these expeditions,
during which the commandant had lain for months helpless
with fever in the lodge of a Cenis chief, he found matters
there in a bad way. The last remaining vessel, the <i>Belle</i>, had
been wrecked on a shoal in the bay. Food was scarce;
ammunition was almost exhausted; and between death from
sickness and losses in Indian skirmishes, the inmates were
reduced to less than forty persons.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="576" />
<p class="caption">La Salle&rsquo;s Map of Texas.</p>
</div>
<p>Despite all this,
however, as the
wayworn explorers
drew near the
walls, their ears
were greeted with
sounds of mirth
and revelry. The
Sieur Barbier
and &ldquo;one of the
maidens&rdquo;&mdash;as
the chronicler relates&mdash;had
just
been married in
the little chapel.
The wedding
party welcomed
their chief with joyous shouts. We can well imagine how,
removing his worn cap, he saluted the youthful pair with a
stately bow. And the same evening, when the colonists
gathered in the log-built hall of the commandant&rsquo;s own quarters
to make merry over the first European wedding on Texas soil,
with what courtly grace did the Sieur de la Salle tread a
measure with the blushing bride!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>This was in October, 1686. On the 12th of January the following
year, La Salle appeared in the open square of the Fort,
dressed in his faded red uniform and equipped for traveling.
His people pressed around him, listening with anxious hearts
to his farewell words. For he was about starting once more
across vast and unknown regions in search of Tonti&mdash;and
help.</p>
<p>One by one he called to his side those whom he had chosen
to accompany him. They numbered twenty&mdash;exactly half of
the remnant of his colony. Among them were two of his own
nephews and his brother, Cavalier; the faithful priest, Father
Anastase; Joutel, the young historian of the colony; Liotot
(Lee-o-to); L&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que (Larsh-v&#257;ke&prime;); Duhaut (Du-ho&prime;); and
Nika (Nee-ka), an Indian hunter who had followed La Salle to
France from Canada.</p>
<p>Sieur Barbier was placed in command of the garrison; and,
after an affectionate farewell, La Salle passed through the gate,
which he was never to enter again, and plunged a last time
into the forest.</p>
<p>Two months later, near the crossing of the Neches River,
Moragnet (Mo-r&auml;-ny&#257;), La Salle&rsquo;s nephew, who had been for
some time on bad terms with L&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que and Duhaut, was
murdered by them while he was sleeping. Nika, who was with
the party (which had been sent out after fresh buffalo meat),
was killed at the same time. The murderers, fearful of La
Salle&rsquo;s just vengeance, determined to take his life also. They
placed themselves in ambush; L&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que, who was only
sixteen years old, was detailed to lead their chief into the
trap.</p>
<p>When La Salle appeared, in search of his nephew, he was
fired upon and instantly killed (March 16, 1687).</p>
<p>Thus perished, by treacherous hands, the gallant and stout-hearted
La Salle&mdash;the soldier, explorer, and dreamer. He
was buried in the lonely spot where he fell. Father Anastase
scooped out a shallow grave for his friend and benefactor, and
pressed the grassy turf upon his breast. And so, within the
borders of Texas&mdash;though the exact spot is unknown&mdash;repose
the mortal remains of its discoverer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Joutel with several of the band succeeded after many adventures
in reaching one of Tonti&rsquo;s settlements on the Arkansas
River. Thence they made their way to Canada.</p>
<p>The assassins and their followers remained with the Indians,
where, one after another, they nearly all met the same bloody
and violent death they had meted out to their victims.</p>
<p>Five years later L&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que with one companion was
recaptured by the Spaniards from the savages and sent to
Madrid.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Tonti of the Iron Hand had waited long and anxiously for
news of his friend. In 1684 he had gone in a canoe down the
Mississippi to its mouth to meet the expedition from France.
The expedition did not appear, and he returned to his post on
the upper Mississippi. He questioned the Indian runners from
the south and west as they passed his camp on their hunting
raids. He could learn nothing of La Salle or his companions.
That intrepid captain seemed to have vanished into the
unknown west. At last, in 1689, he journeyed southward again
in quest of his friend. Vague rumors reached him of men
who had passed through his own forts and tarried to tell the
story of La Salle&rsquo;s death. But he would not believe them. He
entered Texas and traveled as far as the wigwams of the
friendly Cenis. From them he learned the fate of the man he
loved; and the rugged soldier turned aside his head and wept.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 id="c2">2. IN THE NAME OF SPAIN.</h3>
<p>While these things were taking place in an obscure corner of
the New World, there was commotion in the court of Spain.
Word had come over from the &ldquo;Golden West&rdquo; that France had
laid an unlawful hand upon some of the Spanish possessions
there. Letters flew thick and fast between the Spanish viceroy
in Mexico and the Spanish king&rsquo;s<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> ministers. The Viceroy
was ordered to punish the offenders as soon as ever they
could be found; the dark-browed king of Spain was very angry.</p>
<p>All this stir was caused by the capture of the <i>St. Francis</i>, La
Salle&rsquo;s little store-ship in 1684. She was plainly on her way to
some new colony. But where had that colony been planted?
The wary captain of the <i>St. Francis</i> said that he did not know.
Perhaps he told the truth. At any rate, it was not until 1686
and after a world of trouble that the Viceroy in Mexico located
the spot of La Salle&rsquo;s settlement. Spain considered herself at
that time the legitimate owner of all that region which we now
call Texas; she pretended, indeed, to own everything bordering
on the Gulf of Mexico. A military council was therefore
held at the new post of Monclova, and Captain Alonzo de
Leon, the newly appointed governor of Coaquila (afterwards
called Coahuila) (Co-ah-wee&prime;-la), was dispatched to find and
destroy La Salle and his colony. La Salle, with a bullet in his
brain, had been lying for two years in his shallow grave near
the Neches River; but the Viceroy did not know this.</p>
<p>Captain De Leon and his hundred soldiers marched gaily
and confidently from Monclova in a northeasterly direction,
across wild prairie and savage woodland. They were used to
the ways of the Comanches, through whose hunting grounds
they marched, and, at need, could take scalp for scalp; they
were well fed and comfortably clad; the King&rsquo;s pay jingled in
their pockets,&mdash;a brave contrast truly to the starved, ragged,
disheartened colonists at Fort St. Louis!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>But when Captain De Leon and his men at length found the
fort, the unfortunate French colonists, like their chief, had perished.
Their bleaching bones lay scattered about the door of
the blockhouse, where they had made their last desperate stand
against the bloodthirsty Carankawaes. De Leon&rsquo;s heart stirred
with pity as he looked about him, thinking less, perhaps, of the
men&mdash;for it is a soldier&rsquo;s business to die&mdash;than of the delicate
women who had shared their fate.</p>
<p>With the Cenis, into whose friendly wigwams they had
escaped at the time of the massacre, De Leon found several
of the colonists. These
were afterwards sent back to
their homes in France. But
among them there is no mention
of the Sieur Barbier and
his young bride.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="453" />
<p class="caption">The Flag of Spain.</p>
</div>
<p>De Leon, it is said,&mdash;though
this is a much disputed fact,&mdash;called
the country about Fort
St. Louis Texas, because of his
kindly treatment by the Cenis Indians, the word <i>Texas</i> in their
tongue meaning friends.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> On his return to Monclova, he pictured
this Texas as a paradise so fertile and so beautiful that
the viceroy determined to establish there a mission and presidio,&mdash;that
is to say, a church and stronghold,&mdash;for the double
purpose of reducing and converting the Indians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>In 1690 Captain De Leon, with several priests added to his
company of soldiers, marched again to Fort St. Louis. The
broken walls were restored, and once more the air rang with
the cheerful sounds of axe and hammer. The Mission of San
Francisco was begun and dedicated; the Spanish flag fluttered
in the breeze; a hymn of praise and thanksgiving arose from the
chapel; and De Leon took formal possession of the country in
the name of the King of Spain.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, harried by the Indians and too far from
Monclova to receive regular supplies, were soon forced to abandon
Fort St. Louis. Great was the rejoicing among the Lipans
and the Carankawaes when the pale faces disappeared from
among them, leaving the bay once more free to their own
canoes, the prairies open to their moccasined feet.</p>
<p>Neither France nor Spain for a time seemed inclined to
trouble herself further about this disputed property.</p>
<p>But in 1719 a French ship bound for the Mississippi drifted,
like La Salle&rsquo;s fleet, westward to the bay of San Bernard.
Among those who went ashore for recreation, while the sailors
were taking on fresh water, were Monsieur Belleisle, a French
officer, and four of his friends. They did not reappear at the
appointed signal, and the captain, after waiting for them for
some hours, sailed away without them.</p>
<p>Belleisle and his companions were in despair at finding
themselves thus abandoned; they wandered for weeks along
the strange and lonely coast, living, as best they could, upon
roots, berries, and insects. Finally four of the men died of
starvation, leaving Belleisle alone. Weak and despairing, he
made his way to the interior, where he soon fell into the hands
of some Indians, whom he took at first to be cannibals. They
stripped him and divided his clothing among themselves; but
instead of eating him, as he expected they would do, they gave
him to an old woman of the tribe, who made him her slave but
who otherwise treated him with rude kindness. In time he
learned the language of his captors and became a warrior,
sometimes even leading their savage forays.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>One day an embassy from another tribe came to the camp.
Belleisle, listening to their talk, heard the name of St. Denis.
Now St. Denis was one of his own former comrades-in-arms.
Belleisle&rsquo;s heart leaped. He wrote, with ink made of soot, a
few lines on his officer&rsquo;s commission,&mdash;which he had somehow
kept,&mdash;and secretly bribed one of the strange Indians to carry
this message to St. Denis. St. Denis happened at the time to
be at Natchitoches (Nack-ee-tosh) beyond the Sabine River;
when he read the note he was much affected. He immediately
sent horses, arms, and clothing to the captive; Belleisle, by
means of a strategy, escaped with the Indian guides and joined
his friend.</p>
<p>This adventure of Monsieur Belleisle caused him later to
become a part of the history of Fort St. Louis.</p>
<h3 id="c3">3. IN THE NAME OF OBLIVION.</h3>
<p>The unfortunate La Salle had died with his ardent and long-cherished
dream unfulfilled. But after more than thirty years,
another man had begun to realize that dream. Jean Baptiste
Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville had sailed with French ships up
the beloved river; his colonists were fast peopling the beautiful
wilderness, and already the infant city of New Orleans lay
strong and thriving on the bank of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>The commandant of Louisiana, though busied with his growing
colony, kept yet a watchful eye upon the grasping Spaniards,
who claimed the country eastward nearly to the Mississippi.
But France claimed westward as far as the bay of San Bernard,
by virtue of La Salle&rsquo;s discovery. Bienville determined to
make good the claim of France. In August, 1721, he fitted out
a small vessel, the <i>Subtile</i>, told off a detachment of tried soldiers,
and placed Bernard de la Harpe, an experienced captain,
in command. The expedition set out at once to recover
La Salle&rsquo;s old fort. Belleisle, on account of his knowledge of
the country and the Indian language, was sent along as
guide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The surprise and the rage of the Indians when they saw the
hated flag waving again above the fort may be imagined. They
threw themselves with such fury against the newcomers that La
Harpe, seeing his small garrison in danger of massacre, withdrew
quietly, and returned in October to New Orleans.</p>
<p>Fort St. Louis was left at last to a solitude never again to be
broken. Vines grew over the crumbling walls and sprawled
across the floors where human feet had passed; lizards basked
in crevices of the blockhouse; and wild creatures from the wood
took up their abode in the chapel. Day by day and year by
year decay and change went on, until there came a time when
nothing remained to tell of the place where the first settlers of
Texas lived, suffered, rejoiced, and perished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2><span class="h2line1">II.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SAN ANTONIO.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3"><span class="smaller">(1714-1794.)</span></span></h2>
<h3 id="c4">1. A BOLD RIDER.</h3>
<p>In 1714 Juchereau St. Denis rode across Texas, in an
oblique line from a trading post in Louisiana to a presidio on
the Rio Grande River. This was the same St. Denis who afterward,
as already related, rescued his comrade-in-arms Belleisle
from captivity. He had secret orders from Cadillac, the
governor of Louisiana, and his busy brain was teeming with
carefully laid plans of his own. His escort consisted of twelve
white men and two or three Indians. He took his bearings as
he went, carefully marking the way from river to river, from
prairie to forest, from Indian village to buffalo range; thus
sketching out that long thoroughfare which afterwards became
famous as the &ldquo;Old San Antonio Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of the way lay through the lands of unfriendly Indians;
but St. Denis rode as jauntily as if the men at his back were a
thousand instead of a dozen.</p>
<p>And when one day he drew rein on the brow of a certain
hill, and gazed down into the lovely cup-like valley where a few
huts marked the beginnings of San Antonio, he might, for all
signs of fatigue upon his handsome young face, have just
quitted the governor&rsquo;s residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful site for a city,&rdquo; he said to Jallot, his confidential
servant. His pleased eyes roved over the smiling valley,
through which the river ran like a silver thread. Graceful
trees lined the river banks; the tender grass was studded
with a thousand flowers of varied colors; there was a life-giving
softness in the wind that came from the low mountains to the
northward.</p>

<p class="caption">THE MISSION OF SAN JOS&Eacute;.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>St. Denis journeyed on to St. John the Baptist, carrying this
lovely picture in his heart as he went. St. John the Baptist
was a presidio on the Rio Grande River. It was built by
Captain Alonzo de Leon, after his return from Fort St. Louis
in 1689. Its commandant, at the time of the visit of St. Denis,
was Don Pedro de Villescas. To Don Pedro St. Denis unfolded
his mission&mdash;the opening of trade between Louisiana
and Mexico. The friendly commandant could do nothing
without first consulting his superiors; so he asked St. Denis to
wait until a letter could be sent to the governor of the province
at Monclova. St. Denis waited, and while he was waiting
he fell in love with Donna Maria, the commandant&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>The young French officer was so dashing, so courtly, and
withal so good looking, that it is no wonder Don Pedro&rsquo;s
daughter loved him in return; and there were at least two very
happy persons at the Presidio of St. John the Baptist.</p>
<p>But when the courier came back from Monclova, St. Denis
was seized by order of the governor, and was carried under
guard to that city.</p>
<p>The governor of Coahuila was, as it happened, a rejected
suitor of Donna Maria Villescas. Filled with jealous rage, he
threw the young Frenchman into prison and threatened him with
death unless he would give up all claim to his promised bride.</p>
<p>This St. Denis gallantly refused to do. After some months
the governor sent him to the city of Mexico, denouncing him
to the viceroy as a spy against the government. He was again
placed in prison, where he was treated with great severity.</p>
<p>Donna Maria, however, was not idle all this time. She had
sent several spirited letters to the governor at Monclova, and
she now wrote to the viceroy himself. Her letter had the
effect of loosening the chains of her lover.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Marquis de Linares, the viceroy, when he saw his prisoner,
was so charmed that he offered the young Frenchman an
important post in the Spanish army. But St. Denis would not
consent to abandon his own flag. The viceroy then gave him
a handsome horse, and parting from him with regret, sent him
back to the presidio, where he married the loyal Donna Maria.</p>
<p>Before leaving the presidio on his return to Louisiana, he
made secret arrangements for smuggling goods into Mexico.</p>
<p>The viceroy, having a hint of this, did not trouble St. Denis
again; but he decided to establish posts and missions throughout
the New Philippines&mdash;as Texas was still called&mdash;with garrisons
armed to prevent contraband trade. Captain Domingo
Ramon was appointed to carry on this work. He set out at
once from St. John the Baptist for San Antonio, with a company
of soldiers and several friars under his command. St.
Denis, in high spirits and sure of his own success in spite of
Captain Ramon, rode with him, acting as his guide.</p>
<h3 id="c5">2. COWL AND CARBINE.</h3>
<p>Mission and presidio, as already stated, meant church and
fortress. The places chosen for these buildings were generally
in the very midst of populous and fierce Indian tribes. For the
object of the builders was not only to hold the country against
France, but also to reduce the savages and convert them to the
Catholic religion.</p>
<p>The Red Man had already his own rude belief in the Great
Spirit who sat behind the clouds and watched over the flight
of his arrows and the tasseling of his corn. He loved to tell
about the Happy Hunting-grounds to which he would travel
after death, attended by his horse and his dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>It required a great deal of patience and perseverance on the
part of the missionaries to make these wild creatures understand
the meaning of the strange things they saw and heard:
the hymns and prayers which broke the stillness at morning
and at eventide, the candles blazing on the altar, the tinkling
of bells, the movements of the priests, the humble attitude of
the proud Spanish soldiers at mass. They crowded about the
chapels, now accepting the new faith with childlike confidence,
at other times seeking a chance
to massacre priest and soldier
in cold blood.</p>
<p>But these missionaries belonged
to an order whose
business it was to be patient.
They were Franciscans from
the monastery of St. Francis
at Zacatecas in Mexico, and
they were pledged to poverty
and self-denial. Gentle, but
sturdy, these barefooted friars,
in their coarse woolen frocks
and rope girdles, exercised a
strange fascination over the
Indians who fell under their
influence.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic7">

<p class="caption">A Franciscan Father.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Captain Domingo Ramon
went bravely to work with his
soldiers and Franciscans. He was very much loved by the
Indians. They adopted him into their tribes and cheerfully
aided him in the hard labor of clearing and building. Within
a few years the country was dotted with missions. Some of
these were temporary structures, rude and frail; others were
built of stone. The noble and majestic ruins of the latter fill
the beholder to-day with wonder and delight. If the mission
served also as a presidio, it was entitled to a garrison of two
hundred and fifty soldiers; where there was no fortress, the
church itself served as a stronghold. Among the earliest of
the missions thus built were Our Lady of Guadalupe (Gwah-dah-loop&prime;&#257;),
at Victoria (1714); Mission Orquizacas (Or-kee-sa&prime;-kass),
on the San Jacinto River (1715); Mission Dolores
near San Augustine (1716); Adaes, east of the Sabine River
(1718); Nacogdoches (1715); and Espiritu Santo, at Goliad
(La Bahia) (1718).</p>
<p>The Mission Alamo,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> which was to play so prominent a part
in the later history of Texas, was begun under another name,
in 1703, on the Rio Grande River. It was removed to the San
Pedro River at San Antonio in 1718. In 1744 it was finally
built where its ruins now stand, on the Alamo Plaza in San
Antonio, and was called the Church of the Alamo.</p>
<p>Early in 1718 the foundation of San Jos&eacute; (Ho-s&#257;&prime;) de Aguayo,
the largest and finest of all the missions, was laid near San
Antonio. The little settlement which had so pleased the eye
of St. Denis four years before had grown to a village. It had
been laid off and named for the Duke de Bexar (Bair), a viceroy
of Mexico; and St. Denis&rsquo; road, which linked it on the southwest
with St. John the Baptist and on the northeast with Natchitoches
in Louisiana, had already become a traveled highway.
The Mission and Presidio of San Jos&eacute; were therefore of the
first importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Captain Ramon himself may have selected the site. It was
a few miles below the town, on the limpid and swift-flowing
river San Antonio. A day or two after the site was decided
upon, a long procession wound across the beautiful open
prairie from the village. It was headed by a venerable barefoot
Franciscan father, who carried aloft a large wooden cross;
on either side of him walked a friar of the same order, and
behind them came acolytes and altar-boys bearing censer, bell,
and vessels of holy water. Captain Ramon and his soldiers on
horseback, and stiff and erect in their holiday uniforms, followed
with the Spanish flag in their midst; the Mexicans who
composed the slim population of San Antonio came next;
then, grave and stately in their blankets and feathered headdresses
and as proud as the Spaniards themselves, stalked a
hundred or more converted Apache and Comanche warriors.
A rabble of Indian squaws and papooses brought up the rear.</p>
<p>This procession went slowly along under the morning sun,
now over the flower-set prairie, now through a strip of woodland.
The river, breast-high to the women and boys, was
forded, and as the foremost group reached the farther shore,
the old Franciscan lifted his hand; a church hymn, sweet,
powerful, resonant, arose from five hundred throats. Thus
they came, singing, to the place where San Jos&eacute; was to stand.</p>
<p>A large space was marked off; the ground plan of the great
church was sketched on the turf,&mdash;perhaps with the point of
Captain Domingo Ramon&rsquo;s sword; the church prayers were
said, and the corner-stone, already hewn and shaped, was
sprinkled with holy water.</p>
<p>The scene on the spot daily thereafter for many years was a
busy and picturesque one. Everybody worked with a will,&mdash;soldiers,
priests, and Indians, all filled with a holy zeal.
Even the Indian women fetched sand in their aprons, and the
Indian children set their small brown bodies against the stones
and helped push them into place. Tradition says that the
people brought milk from their goats and cows to mix the mortar,
thereby making it firmer and more lasting.</p>
<p>The beautiful twin towers went slowly up; the great dome
was rounded over the main chapel; the double row of arched
cloisters stretched their lovely length along the wall; the artist,
Juan Huicar (wee&prime;-car), sent out by the king of Spain, set his
fine carvings above the wide doors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>At the same time the enclosing wall was raised; the fort
with its flying buttresses, the guardhouse, the huts into which
the Indian converts were locked at night&mdash;all these were completed.
Orchards and gardens were planted, and irrigating
ditches were dug. Again and again the work was interrupted
by attacks from Indians; but when the fight was over the dead
were buried, the wounded were cared for, and the building and
planting went on as before.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Such was the manner of the building of the Texas missions.
It took sixty years to complete San Jos&eacute;. In the meantime
the handsome Mission of La Purissima Concepcion (Immaculate
Conception) and San Francisco de la Espada (St. Francis of
the Sword) were erected, both also on the San Antonio River.</p>
<p>The Mission of San Saba was built in 1734, on the San Saba
River in what is now Menard County. The good fathers were
at first very successful in converting the Apaches and the
Comanches, who flocked to them in great numbers. But the
reopening of <i>Las Almagras</i> (red ores), an old silver mine near
the mission, brought into the neighborhood many reckless
men; and quarrels soon arose between them and the Indians&mdash;quarrels
which were one day to bear bitter fruit.</p>
<h3 id="c6">3. A HURRIED RIDE.</h3>
<p>In 1719 St. Denis was at Natchitoches, which was one of the
outposts of the French in Louisiana and close to the Texas
border. He had traveled back and forth through Texas more
than once since his first trip to the presidio on the Rio
Grande; and he had spent much of his time in Mexican dungeons.
But for that he bore the Spaniards no great ill-will.
He had escaped from prison and brought his beautiful Mexican
wife away with him; and when he made his flying journeys he
turned aside, no doubt, to see his Spanish friend, Captain
Domingo Ramon&mdash;who, by the way, was his wife&rsquo;s uncle&mdash;and
to admire the missions which were going up in every direction
under that captain&rsquo;s vigorous management. But now things
were changed. A few months before, France and Spain, never
on good terms with each other, had declared open war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>St. Denis, if the truth were told, was glad of a chance to
fight somebody besides Indians. He was right weary of the
skulking ways of the red warrior with his tomahawk, his paint
and feathers, and his savage desire to carry scalps at his belt.
He longed for a good honest brush with white men, who fought
openly with gun and sword&mdash;men, for example, like his good
friend Captain Ramon and his troop of jolly soldiers!</p>
<p>He leaped lightly into the saddle one morning and galloped
out of Natchitoches at the head of a hundred and fifty men.
Bernard de la Harpe, in joint command of the expedition, rode
by his side.</p>
<p>They crossed the Sabine River and attacked the garrisons at
the Missions of Nacogdoches, Aes, and Orquizacas, all of
whom, surprised by the sudden onslaught, retreated before
them. It was a lively chase across the vast territory, with
a good deal of skirmishing; and it ended only when the
Spaniards were safe inside the town of San Antonio.</p>
<p>St. Denis, drawing rein on the brow of the hill and gazing
down once more into the lovely valley, saw a sort of orderly
confusion on an open plaza in the heart of the town; horsemen
were gathering, men were moving hurriedly about, and
from the midst of the bustle the clear tones of a bell suddenly
fell upon the air. It was the call to arms!</p>
<p>St. Denis smiled and turned to La Harpe: &ldquo;It is high time
we were riding homeward,&rdquo; he said gaily, with a glance at their
small band of wayworn troopers; and turning their horses&rsquo;
heads they galloped away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>None too soon! For shortly afterwards the Marquis de
Aguayo, governor of the province, came out of the town with
a fresh troop of five hundred Spaniards, tried soldiers and
eager recruits, and galloped in pursuit of the flying Frenchmen.
It was another lively chase across the vast territory;
but this time it was France who retreated, with Spain at her
heels. Captain Ramon, quite as anxious for a tilt with civilized
soldiers as his friendly enemy and nephew-in-law St. Denis,
left the work of mission-building in the hands of his friars, and,
as second in command, joined the governor-general in this
pursuit.</p>
<p>Aguayo, following the example of St. Denis, did not pause
until the intruders were safe in their own citadel at Natchitoches;
then he replaced at the Missions of Orquizacas and Aes
the men whom he had brought back with him, and he left for
their protection a stout garrison at the Mission of Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar (Our Lady of the Font), about twenty miles
west of Natchitoches.</p>
<p>He was as keenly alive as St. Denis himself to the natural
beauty of the valley watered by the San Pedro and San Antonio
Rivers; and on his return to San Antonio he set on foot many
improvements, including the widening and deepening of the
irrigating ditches.</p>
<p>These irrigating ditches were called <i>acequias</i> (a-s&#257;&prime;-kee-a).
They are still in use, and many of them are very beautiful.
One known as the Acequia Madre, or Mother Ditch, is as
deep and wide as a small rivulet; the living waters, pure and
cool, rush along a bed lined and parapeted with stone, and
overhung with pomegranates and rustling banana leaves.</p>
<p>The water from the ditches is turned, by means of gates,
into the fields and gardens which lie along its course. Each
landowner is entitled to so much water a day, or at a stated
period. This inflow of the crystal flood is called the <i>saca de
agua</i> (taking the water), and is hailed with delight as it comes
singing its way through corn-row, garden-patch, and rose-bower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>In the early days the completing of a water-ditch was celebrated
as a feast. Rows of cactus were planted on its banks
to keep off cattle, and shade-trees were set out along its course.
A priest, attended by acolytes, blessed the water. The following
day a drum was beaten at morning mass, and all those who
had contributed in money or labor to the making of the ditch
were summoned to the church to take part in the Suerte
(soo-air&prime;-ta),&mdash;a lottery for the drawing of the land watered by
the new sluice. Tickets were placed in an urn and were
drawn out by two children. The lucky holders of the highest
numbers got the best lands. At night, by way of winding up
the feast, there would be a procession and a <i>fandango</i><a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> on the
plaza.</p>
<p>The good Marquis de Aguayo further recommended to the
Spanish government at Madrid to send colonists to the province.
&ldquo;One family,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is better than a hundred
soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, having done all he could for the New Philippines, he
went back to his official residence at Monclova, attended as
far as St. John the Baptist by Captain Ramon.</p>
<h3 id="c7">4. INDIOS BRAVOS.</h3>
<p>The Spanish government, acting on the governor-general&rsquo;s
advice, ordered four hundred families to be sent out to the
New Philippines from the Canary Islands. These islands,
situated off the coast of Africa, belonged to Spain by right of
conquest, and were settled by Spaniards of pure blood, noted
for their honor and chastity, and for their devotion to the
Catholic religion. Of the four hundred families only thirteen
ever came. They reached San Antonio by way of Mexico in
1729, bringing with them their stores of clothing, silverware,
and jewels. They built their dwellings around the present
square of the Constitution, which they called <i>Plaza de las Islas</i>
(Square of the Islands), in homesick memory of the sea-girt
isles they had left behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Other colonists from Monterey and from Lake Teztuco,
in Mexico, followed; houses sprung up beside the musical
water-ways; vines were trained over the yellow adobe walls;
semi-tropical vegetation made a paradise of the spreading
fields and gardens. Finally, the newcomers, emulous of the
growing walls of San Jos&eacute;, laid on their plaza the foundation
(1731) of San Fernando Church.</p>
<p>Enlarged and rebuilt on the same spot, San Fernando
remains to this day the parish church of the Spanish-speaking
Catholics of San Antonio.</p>
<p>But the settlers, or townspeople&mdash;as they may now be
called&mdash;were full of anxiety in those troublous times. No
more French soldiers, it is true, came riding across the border,
chasing the Spanish troops to their very gates. But there
were the Apaches and the Comanches. For in spite of the
efforts of Spanish friars and Spanish soldiers, but few of the
Apaches and Comanches had become <i>Indios reducidos</i> (converted
Indians). Thousands of <i>Indios bravos</i> (wild Indians),
as savage and cruel as if a mission had never been built,
roamed the country, ready to swoop down at any moment upon
the ill-guarded little post. A messenger would hurry in, perhaps
from the missions below, which kept ever a keen lookout,
breathless with the news that the Apaches were creeping
stealthily upon the town. Or, suddenly and without warning,
a ringing war-whoop would echo in the air, and leaping from
cover to cover among the scattered houses, the Comanches,
tomahawk in hand, would pursue their hapless victims to some
last hiding-place; then, leaving death and desolation behind,
they would vanish as suddenly as they had come.</p>
<p>At last the new settlers determined to put an end to this
state of affairs. They organized themselves into a small army,
and aided by the little garrison of soldiers then stationed there,
they marched against their Indian foes, whom they defeated in
a pitched battle.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic8">

<p class="caption">THE MISSION OF LA PURISSIMA CONCEPCION.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>This victory (in 1732) gave some security to the place.
The <i>Indian bravos</i> still harried the country, killing those who
ventured far from post and mission, and plundering where they
could not kill. A number of years later (1752), after a fresh
quarrel with the miners at Las Almagras, they fell upon the
Mission of San Saba, and butchered every human creature
within its walls. But rarely did they again venture near the
dwellings of those determined pale-faces who had overcome
them on their own hunting-grounds.</p>
<h3 id="c8">5. ALONG THE OLD SAN ANTONIO ROAD.</h3>
<p>The years drifted on, peaceful and sluggish, towards the end
of the eighteenth century. There were few happenings either
in San Antonio itself or in the province, which was at last laid
down on the map as Texas. There was no further dispute
concerning boundary lines or property. Spain was the lawful
owner of everything west of the Mississippi River. For Louis
the Fifteenth of France, in 1762, for state reasons, presented
to the King of Spain the handsome French province of Louisiana.
The people of Louisiana were very angry when they
learned&mdash;more than a year after the transfer&mdash;that they had
been handed over without their knowledge or consent to the
hated Spaniard. But Louis did not trouble himself in the least
about what they thought or felt. Thus, the colonists being all
Spanish subjects, were bound to peace among themselves.
Even the dashing St. Denis, had he lived so long, could have
found nobody to fight except the despised Indian. But that
doughty warrior and courtly gentleman had long since fired his
last shot on the field, and trod his last measure in the dance.
According to the old chroniclers he remained to the end of his
life &ldquo;a devoted friend and a noble fighter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>In 1729 a widespread plot was formed among the Indians in
Texas and Louisiana to massacre all white people within
reach, Spanish and French, men, women, and children. A
friendly chief warned St. Denis of the plot. He gathered his
troopers hastily together and rode out of Natchitoches, where
he had continued in command, and in a short time defeated
and scattered the tribes. After this they hated and feared
him, but they looked upon him with awe, believing him to be
protected by their own Manitou.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic9">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="564" />
<p class="caption">The Cathedral of San Fernando.</p>
</div>
<p>He was at length killed by the chief of the Natchez Indians.
He lies buried near the town of Natchitoches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>In spite of the peace between Spain and France (1762)&mdash;or
perhaps because of it&mdash;there was little progress in Texas.
Spain forbade her colonists to trade with other nations; she
did not allow them to manufacture anything that could be
made in the mother-country, or to plant anything that could
with profit be sent over from there. They were even forbidden
to trade with their fellow-colonists in Louisiana.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> Under
these hard conditions settlers came in slowly. Texas remained
almost neglected, peopled only by fierce savages.</p>
<p>But the little town in the southwest had a life of its own.
Nearly everybody who had any business with Texas or Mexico
traveled the Old San Antonio Road laid out by St. Denis in
1714; and all travelers halted at this lovely oasis in the wilderness.
They were always loth to go away. For there were wonderful
<i>fiestas</i> (feasts) in the Churches of the Alamo and San
Fernando, and solemn processions to the grand Missions of
Concepcion and San Jos&eacute;; there were stately gatherings in
the houses of the Island Spaniards, and merry boating parties
on the blue-green waters of the river San Antonio. There
were gay dances on the plaza at night to the music of guitar
and castanet, and Mexican jugglers throwing balls and knives
by the light of smoking torches. Bands of Mexican muleteers
jingled in from the presidio on the Rio Grande, driving before
them trains of mules loaded with ingots of silver, on their way
to Natchitoches, four hundred miles distant; caravans traveling
westward with bales of smuggled goods crawled lazily through
the narrow streets. There was a continued coming and going
of swarthy soldiers and black-gowned priests, governors, bishops,
alcades, and christianized Indians; among them appeared, now
and then, the fair face and wiry form of the American, the forerunner
of that race which was one day to sweep all the others
out of its path and to possess the land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Once, in 1779, when Spain and England were at war with
each other, there was even more than the usual stir on the
Military Plaza. Nearly all the inhabitants of the town were
gathered about the doors of the Church of the Alamo, where a
priest was saying mass. Presently there was a burst of martial
music, and a little company of soldiers came out; their heads
were lifted proudly and their step was firm and assured. A
cheer broke forth from the crowd; the soldiers sent back an
answering shout as they mounted their waiting horses and rode
away under the gaudy pennon of Leon and Castile.</p>
<p>Spain was at this time at war with England, and this handful
of fighting men was the quota of troops furnished by the Spanish
province of Texas to Don Galvez, the commander-in-chief
of the army at New Orleans. They reached Louisiana in time
to take an active part in the war and to rejoice with Galvez
over his victories at Natchez, Mobile, and Pensacola.</p>
<p>In 1794 all the missions were secularized; that is, the control
of them was taken away from the priests and given to the
civil authorities. Upon this, the Missions of San Jos&eacute; and
Concepcion ceased to be the centers of activity they had been
for nearly a century. San Antonio was shorn of a part of her
glory. The majestic buildings remained, but the pomp and
circumstance of fortress and chapel had forever departed.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line3"><span class="smaller">(1794-1821.)</span></span></h2>
<h3 id="c9">1. A FATAL VENTURE.</h3>
<p>One of the earliest missions planned by Captain Ramon was
that of Our Lady of Nacogdoches (1715). It was built on the
lands of the Naugodoches Indians, not far from the disputed
boundary of Texas, and nearly on a line with the French post
of Natchitoches in Louisiana. Some priests, whose duty it was
to convert the Indians, were placed there, and with them a
small garrison of Spanish soldiers to watch the French at
Natchitoches. This was one of those garrisons surprised in
1718 by St. Denis, and driven to the gates of San Antonio.
The soldiers were brought back and reinstated by Aguayo; and
from that time on, to the close of the century, the little military
post was kept up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Monsieur de Pag&egrave;s, a French gentleman who in 1766 passed
across Texas on a voyage around the world, received from the
missionary fathers at Aes, Adaes, and Nacogdoches a hospitable
welcome. He describes particularly the Mission of
&ldquo;Naquadock&rdquo; (Nacogdoches) with its &ldquo;plaza and its pleasant
trees,&rdquo; and says that the &ldquo;half-savage Spanish soldiers&rdquo; at the
presidio, when they were upon their horses, recalled to his
mind the ancient chevaliers. The Spanish &ldquo;bold-rider&rdquo; wore
a cuirass of antelope skin and carried a shield, a large sword, a
carbine, and a pair of pistols. His arms and the equipment of
his horse were very heavy and cumbersome, but he was an
&ldquo;amazing good fighter.&rdquo; Monsieur de Pag&egrave;s, who was an
officer in the French navy, was also a correspondent of the
Academy of Sciences at Paris. He took careful notes in all
the countries through which he passed. He describes the soil
and climate of Texas and the animals, especially the fine,
robust horses. &ldquo;A good horse,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;may be had for a
pair of shoes.&rdquo; But his greatest interest is in the savages. He
mentions the Comanches, the Apaches, the Adaes, and the
Tehas tribes. The Tehas, he says, were a &ldquo;corn-growing
people.&rdquo; He spent some time at the Mission of Nacogdoches
(&ldquo;Naquadock&rdquo;) in company with a deposed governor of the
province.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic10">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="500" />
<p class="caption">De Pag&egrave;s&rsquo; Map of Texas.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1778 a stone fort, which still stands, was built at Nacogdoches
by Captain Gil Y Barbo for the accommodation of the
Spanish soldiers. A few huts were clustered about the presidio,
for it was on the Old San Antonio Road and was a
stopping-place for travelers; but it was a dull and lonely spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Suddenly, with the birth of a new century, it awoke from its
long slumber and became, in a way, the starting-point of Texas
history. It was the gateway through which Anglo-American
energy and ambition came in to Texas. From its plaza unrolled
a panorama full of life and vigor: scenes in which adventurers,
freebooters, patriots, and dreamers played their parts.</p>
<p>The panorama opens with Philip Nolan.</p>
<p>Philip Nolan, a young man of Irish descent, obtained in
1797 a permit from De Nava, the Spanish commandant-general
of Texas, to collect in that province wild horses for the American
army. He entered the province, made friends with the
Indians, and succeeded in gathering twelve hundred mustangs,
which he drove across the border. He drew and brought back
with him at this time a map of Texas, the first one ever made.
This map he gave to Baron Carondelet, the Spanish governor
at New Orleans.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Three years later, with the same permit and ostensibly on
the same errand, he started westward from Natchez, Mississippi.
He had with him seventeen white men and one negro.
His second in command was a nineteen-year-old lad named
Ellis Bean. The men were all young, most of them being
under thirty and many of them hardly more than twenty years
of age.</p>
<p>They traveled on horseback across the wilderness, and some
months later they encamped in the neighborhood of the present
city of Waco, where they found &ldquo;elk and deer plenty, some
buffalo, and thousands of wild horses.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> In a short time they
had caught and penned three hundred mustangs. The Indians
were very friendly. At one time two hundred Comanches visited
them in their camp. In return they spent a month in the
wigwams of that tribe. Then they went back to their business
of capturing wild horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>But orders in the meantime had come from De Nava to
Musquiz, the Spanish captain at Nacogdoches, to arrest Nolan
at all hazards. He had been denounced to the Spanish government
as a traitor, and it was believed that he had come to
Texas for the purpose of
setting up a republic of his
own, or to further the plans
of Aaron Burr.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="pic11">

<p class="caption">Ellis P. Bean.</p>
</div>
<p>Musquiz left Nacogdoches
on the 4th of March, 1801,
with one hundred soldiers,
in search of the supposed
conspirator. After a few
days&rsquo; march he sent for El
Blanco, a famous Indian
chief, and offered him a large
bribe if he would lead him
to Nolan&rsquo;s camp. El Blanco
proudly spurned this base
offer. Some Indian spies, however, served as guides, and at
daybreak on the 22d of March Musquiz found the camp. He
attacked Nolan and his men, who returned his fire from their
rude blockhouse. Nolan, whose rifle had been stolen from him
by a deserter from his own camp, was killed in a few moments.
Bean took command and the fighting went on desperately for
some time. Finally, on a promise from the Spaniards that they
should be set free as soon as they reached Nacogdoches, the
outnumbered Americans surrendered. They buried their gallant
leader, whose dream of a republic, if he had one, died with
him; and they set out with their captors for the Presidio of
Nacogdoches. There, instead of the promised freedom, they
found chains and captivity. They were heavily ironed and
placed in close confinement. At the end of a month they were
marched into the plaza, bound together, two and two. There
was a beating of drums and a fluttering of Spanish pennons.
The hearts of the poor young prisoners beat high with hope.
Knowing that they had been guilty of no crime, they seemed
already to feel their chains falling off, and they laughed joyfully,
lifting their pallid faces to the free blue sky. But a harsh
voice gave the order &ldquo;Forward March!&rdquo; and driven by brutal
guards they limped painfully away to Mexican dungeons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>It was six years before the King of Spain found time to
sentence these prisoners. A royal decree then came (1807)
ordering every fifth man to be shot. By this time but nine
were left alive, and the officer in charge decided that one only
should suffer death.</p>
<p>The nine wretched captives threw dice to determine which of
their number should die. The lot fell to Ephraim Blackburn,
the oldest man among them. He was executed without delay.</p>
<p>Only one of the others ever breathed the blessed air of freedom
again. Ellis Bean, after many strange and thrilling adventures,
finally escaped. His companions, to a man, perished
in loathsome Mexican prisons, some of them within a short
time, others after a wretched captivity of more than fifteen
years,&mdash;all ignorant to the last of the cause of their imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="c10">2. THE DISPUTED BOUNDARY LINE.</h3>
<p>While Nacogdoches was rubbing her sleepy eyes and staring
at the <i>Americanos</i>, who kept coming into Texas in spite of the
scant welcome they got there, a man was strutting about the
court at Madrid in Spain, carrying Texas, so to speak, in his
pocket. Manuel de Godoy, called <i>El Principe de la Paz</i> (The
Prince of the Peace), who, from a private in the King&rsquo;s Guards
had come to be a grandee of Spain and first minister of the
King&rsquo;s council, was a corrupt courtier, cordially hated by the
people, but a favorite both of the King and the Queen.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> They
had given him the highest honors and titles possible in Spain
and finally they had made him a present of the territory of
Texas. To this princely gift they added soldiers and ships
and a large number of young women from the asylums in Spain.
Godoy in his dreams already saw himself ruling in a semi-barbaric
fashion over his kingdom in the &ldquo;golden west.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<div class="img" id="pic12">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="409" />
<p class="caption">Old Stone Fort at Nacogdoches.</p>
</div>
<p>The attitude of Napoleon Bonaparte toward Spain put an
end to this curious scheme. Soldiers and ships were ordered
to another service; the young women were returned to their
asylums; and Godoy was sent into dishonorable exile with his
pocket empty, at least of Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Spain, tired of the troublesome present she had received from
Louis the Fifteenth, one fine day in 1800 handed Louisiana back
to France. But before the French colonists had time to rejoice,
Napoleon in 1803 sold them and their province to the United
States. Again they were very angry; but, as before, nobody
cared in the least what they thought or how they felt.</p>
<p>The old dispute concerning the boundary between Louisiana
and Texas was revived by this transaction. Spain claimed
eastward as far toward the Mississippi River as she dared. The
United States would gladly have reached out westward to the
Rio Grande. The quarrel at last grew so bitter that both
countries prepared to go to war (1806).</p>
<p>Nacogdoches and Natchitoches glared at each other across
the Sabine River, like two watch-dogs snarling and showing
their teeth.</p>
<p>Antonio Cordero, governor of Texas, hurried by way of the
Old San Antonio Road from San Antonio to Nacogdoches.
The lonely presidio then fairly thrilled; for fortifications were
thrown up, provisions were brought in, and the place was put
in a state of defense. Soldiers were also stationed at the
mouth of the Trinity River, at the old fort at Adaes, and at
other points. At length in August, 1806, Simon Herrera,
commanding the Spanish troops with Cordero as his second,
marched in with twelve hundred men at his back.</p>
<p>At Natchitoches also there was bustle and excitement.
Governor Claiborne, followed at once by General Wilkinson
of the United States army, had come up from New Orleans.
Several angry messages passed between Generals Wilkinson
and Herrera, but neither would yield an inch in his demands;
and on the 22d of October General Wilkinson marched his
troops to the east bank of the Sabine River and camped there.
General Herrera&rsquo;s camp was on the west bank, just opposite.
The stream alone separated the two armies. On both sides
everything was in readiness for a battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>But in the hush of the night (November 5) the two generals
met and held a secret council. The next day (Nov. 6, 1806),
to the surprise of all and greatly to the disappointment of the
American soldiers, it was announced that the affair had been
peacefully settled. A strip of land between the Sabine River
and a creek called the Arroyo Hondo seven miles west of
Natchitoches, was declared neutral ground,&mdash;that is, ground to
be occupied by neither country until the boundary line could
be fixed by a state treaty.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The Americans marched away, grumbling openly; the
Spanish generals, having got more than they expected,
returned well pleased to Nacogdoches.</p>
<p>Nacogdoches had ceased to be simply a stopping-place for
travelers; it vied with its distant neighbor, San Antonio, in
the gaiety of its social life. The Spanish officers, especially
the commandant Herrera, were noted for their gracious and
courtly manners. Some American families of position had
moved in; there was even a hotel. The presidio had become
a town.</p>
<h3 id="c11">3. THE NEUTRAL GROUND.</h3>
<p>One day in 1812 a young man&mdash;an American&mdash;wearing the
uniform of the United States army crossed the Arroyo Hondo
on horseback and entered the Neutral Ground. He withdrew
a little from the road, dismounted, and seated himself upon a
fallen log, seeming to await some one or something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Soon a second rider appeared, threading his way through
the forest trees. He was a Spaniard of soldierly bearing, and
his somewhat stern features offered a marked contrast to the
eager face of the first comer. He dismounted with a courteous
greeting, sat down in his
turn, and drawing a map
from his pocket, he spread
it upon his knees.</p>
<p>The Spaniard was
Colonel Bernardo Gutierrez
de Lara. The American
was Lieutenant
Augustus Magee.</p>

<p>The Neutral Ground
from the moment of the
treaty between Herrera
and Wilkinson in 1806
became the resort of all
sorts of lawless men, who,
subject to no authority,
robbed and murdered at
will the travelers passing
across this No Man&rsquo;s
Land. The danger at last became so great that the United
States sent a squad of soldiers to serve as an escort to people
whose business led them between the Sabine and Natchitoches.
Lieutenant Magee was placed in command of this escort. He
was a bold and gallant young fellow, within whose romantic
brain soon came the idea of following out Nolan&rsquo;s supposed
plan of founding an independent republic in Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>He confided his project to Gutierrez, who had fled to Natchitoches
after the failure of a similar attempt in Mexico, in which
he had taken part. Gutierrez was delighted. He undertook
to gain over the Mexicans in Texas. Magee resigned his
position in the United States army and soon succeeded in
forming a band composed of adventurers and desperadoes from
the Neutral Ground, a number of Indians, some Mexicans, and
a few Americans of good character. Gutierrez, on account of
his influence over his countrymen, was put in command.
Magee, however, was the leading spirit.</p>
<p>It was to talk over their scheme of invasion and conquest,
to consult maps and arrange routes, that Magee and Gutierrez
had met on the banks of the Arroyo Hondo.</p>
<p>Magee started soon after for New Orleans to get money and
recruits. Gutierrez with a few men crossed the Sabine
and took possession of Nacogdoches, which was at once
abandoned by the Spaniards. From that place he marched
to join Magee and the main army on the Trinity River.</p>
<p>The first movement of this army of republicans, which numbered
several hundred men, was upon La Bahia (Goliad). The
Spanish garrison in the fortress there joined them, surrendering,
along with other military stores, the cannon brought over
by La Salle in 1685.</p>
<p>Hardly, however, were the republicans within the fort when
they were attacked by the Spanish army, under Governor Salcedo
and General Herrera.</p>
<p>The fighting was at great odds, but the little band of republicans
held their own during several months, their greatest loss
being the death of their brave and spirited young leader,
Magee, who, wasted with consumption, died in February,
1813.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Shortly afterwards a fierce hand-to-hand skirmish took place.
In this the republicans were victorious. The Spaniards thereupon
gave up the siege and retreated to San Antonio. The
republicans followed under Colonel Kemper, who had succeeded
Magee. On the 28th of March, 1813, a bloody battle
took place on the Rosillo Creek, nine miles from San Antonio.
The Spaniards were defeated with the loss of one thousand
men. The victorious army marched into San Antonio, flying
their flag in triumph. In the fortress of the Alamo they found
seventeen prisoners, whom they released; the private soldiers
taken prisoners at Rosillo were all set at liberty. The officers
were at first paroled; but afterward by order of Gutierrez, or
at least with his consent, they were marched by a company of
Mexican soldiers to a place on the river below the town; there
they were stripped, their hands were bound behind their backs,
and their throats cut.</p>
<p>Among those thus brutally butchered were Salcedo, Governor
of New Leon, Governor Cordero, and the brave and polished
Herrera.</p>
<p>Many of the better class of Americans, among them the
commanding officer, Colonel Kemper, disgusted with the savagery
of Gutierrez, left the army. The republicans who
remained were filled with triumph; intoxicated with success,
they gave themselves up to rioting and rejoicing.</p>
<p>Their enthusiasm was increased by a victory over another
Spanish force sent against them under the command of Don Y
Elisondo (El-ee-son&prime;do). In this battle, fought June 4, the Spaniards
lost over a thousand men, dead, wounded, and prisoners.</p>
<p>But the tide of success had reached its height; it began to
turn. Gutierrez having retired to Natchitoches, General
Toledo (To-l&#257;&prime;do) was now in command of the republicans.
On the 18th of August he marched out of San Antonio to
attack a third Spanish army commanded by General Arredondo,
who had thrown up breastworks on the Medina near the town.</p>
<p>The result was a terrific defeat for the republicans. Almost
the entire army was destroyed; many were killed; those taken
prisoners were butchered as cruelly as Herrera and his brother
officers had been. Out of eight hundred and fifty Americans,
only ninety-three escaped. One by one these stole through
Nacogdoches on their way back to the safe thickets of the
Neutral Ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h3 id="c12">4. THE RED HOUSE.</h3>
<p>Nacogdoches, it may be supposed, had grown accustomed to
that dream of a Texas Republic which from time to time
caused the air about her stone fort to thrill and vibrate; she
was accustomed, too, to see that dream end in bloodshed and
death.</p>
<p>So it was an old story when in 1819 some three hundred
Americans came tramping in, ready, as they imagined, to convert
Texas into a free and independent state. This new expedition,
organized at Natchez, Mississippi, was conducted by
Dr. James Long of Tennessee, an energetic patriot who had
served as a surgeon in Jackson&rsquo;s army at the battle of New
Orleans.</p>
<p>General Long&rsquo;s brother, David, accompanied him; and his
wife and her sister followed, under the conduct of Randall
Jones. They arrived at Nacogdoches soon after the new
republicans had taken peaceful possession of the town.</p>
<p>A legislative body was formed. One of its members was
Bernardo Gutierrez, who had continued to live at Natchitoches.
The Republic of Texas was proclaimed, and land and revenue
laws were passed. A newspaper, the first in Texas, was started
by Horatio Bigelow, a member of the council.</p>
<p>General Long&rsquo;s next step was to take possession of the
country and strengthen the infant government. He placed
detachments of men at various points on the Brazos and
Trinity Rivers, opened trade with the Indians, and sent James
Gaines, one of his lieutenants, to Galveston Island to get the
assistance of Lafitte.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Jean Lafitte, a Frenchman by birth, had, while yet a mere
lad, commanded a privateer which sailed the Gulf of Mexico.
Later, with his two brothers, he had been, nominally, a blacksmith
in New Orleans; but while hammering horseshoes and
making wagon-tires, he was really engaged in smuggling.
After a while, he dropped all pretense, and gathering together
a band of reckless men he established himself in 1810 on the
island of Grand Terre, a swampy lowland in Louisiana near
the Gulf coast. From there he plied his unlawful trade. His
band became finally so bold and troublesome that a reward
was offered for their leader&rsquo;s head. This proclamation, signed
by Governor Claiborne, was posted
about New Orleans; and more than
once the daring freebooter was seen
talking gaily with a group of friends,
leaning the while with folded arms
against a wall upon which flamed in
big letters the governor&rsquo;s mandate
demanding his head. He was never
captured.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic14">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="599" />
<p class="caption">Jean Lafitte.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1814, when the United States
and England were at war, a British
officer visited Lafitte at Grand Terre
and offered him the command of a
frigate if he would join the British
navy. Lafitte instead offered his
services to General Jackson, fought
gallantly at the battle of New Orleans, and received a full
pardon from the United States government.</p>
<p>But his restless spirit would not long suffer him to remain
inactive. In 1816 he fitted out a schooner (<i>The Pride</i>) and
sailed to the uninhabited island of Galveston.</p>
<p>This island was discovered by La Salle as he coasted along
the Gulf in 1684, seeking the Mississippi River. He called it
the Island of St. Louis. It was afterward known as Snake
Island, and received its present name, about 1775, in honor of
Don Jos&eacute; Galvez, governor of Louisiana and son of the
viceroy of Mexico.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>It had been occupied for a short time (1816) by a band of
Mexican &ldquo;republicans,&rdquo; under Manuel Herrera and Xavier
Mina. They were joined by Luis d&rsquo;Aury, a Mexican naval
officer, and Colonel Perry, an American who had taken part in
Magee&rsquo;s ill-fated expedition. They set up a sort of republic
on the island. Their fleet of twelve armed vessels sailed the
Gulf, and for a time the enterprise prospered. But the little
republic did not last long. The leaders quarreled among
themselves; the United States denounced their sailors as
pirates; the settlement was broken up, and Galveston returned
to its native solitude.</p>
<p>The island was covered with beautiful green grass; there
were no shrubs, and the only trees were three live oaks clustered
together about midway of the island. Its wide beach
shone like silver in the sunlight. Here in a short time Lafitte
had established a miniature kingdom. Adventurers came flocking
to him from every direction, and in less than a year there
were a thousand persons on the island. Lafitte, bearing the
proud title of &ldquo;Lord of Galveston,&rdquo; held absolute sway over
them. The fort and the town, which he named Campeachy,
were kept under strict military rule. The bay harbored a fleet
of swift vessels, sailed by fearless pirates who swept the Gulf,
capturing and plundering Spanish ships and bringing the rich
spoils to be divided by their chief. On the incoming Spanish
barques there were bales of silks and satins, woven for the dark-eyed
dames of Mexico, and soft carpets and priceless hangings
for their houses; there were rare wines for the tables
of the viceroys, and gold-embroidered altar-cloths for the
churches. On outgoing Mexican vessels there were bars of
silver and ingots of gold, tropical spices and dyes, uncut
jewels, and beautiful skins of wild animals. All these treasures
were unrolled and spread out on the open square of the
fort, and each man was allotted his share. Lafitte was generous
with the goods brought in by his freebooters. Once
from a rich &ldquo;haul&rdquo; he took for his own share only a slim gold
chain and seal which had been removed from the neck of a
portly Mexican bishop on his way to visit Rome. This chain
and seal were given by the pirate to Rezin Bowie, a brother of
James Bowie. It remains in the Bowie family to this day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Besides the regular business of piracy, which was politely
called privateering, a brisk slave-trade was carried on between
the island and the shores of Africa. Slave-ships came boldly
into the harbor and landed their cargoes of black humanity at
Campeachy. The negro gangs were driven into the fort, where
they were sold <i>by the pound</i>. The price paid was generally one
dollar a pound, though prices sometimes fell so low that an
able-bodied man or woman could be bought for forty dollars.
The purchasers hurried the unhappy Africans through the
country to Baton Rouge and New Orleans, where they were
resold at higher prices.</p>
<p>Lafitte was adored by his followers, though he ruled them as
with a rod of iron. In person he was tall, dark, and handsome,
with stern eyes and a winning smile. He wore a uniform of
dark green cloth, a crimson sash, and an otter-skin cap. He
lived in great state, in a richly furnished dwelling, called, from
its color, the &ldquo;Red House,&rdquo; and entertained there in an almost
princely manner the strangers whom business, curiosity, or
misfortune brought to the island.</p>
<p>The Carankawae Indians, who had formerly held the strip
of silver sand as their own fishing-ground, visited the newcomers,
and gazed with wonder at their ships, their houses,
and their cannon. But in a short time a quarrel arose between
some of the freebooters and the chiefs, and four of Lafitte&rsquo;s
men were killed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Lafitte hastened to avenge their death. He marched to the
Three Trees, where three hundred Carankawaes were encamped.
His own force numbered less than two hundred, but they were
well armed and provided with two pieces of artillery. The
Indians after three days of hard fighting were defeated, and
withdrew to the mainland. This defeat increased their hatred
of the whites. But they gave no further trouble to Lafitte.</p>
<h3 id="c13">5. THE CHAMP D&rsquo;ASILE.</h3>
<p>The Lord of Galveston was at the height of his power in
March, 1818, when a colony composed of his own countrymen
sailed into the bay. They were led by General Lallemand,
one of Napoleon Bonaparte&rsquo;s old officers. The empire had
fallen, Bonaparte was in exile at St. Helena, and Lallemand,
no longer happy or safe in France, decided to form somewhere
in the New World a <i>Champ d&rsquo;Asile</i> (Place of Refuge). His
choice finally fell upon Texas. He left France in October,
1817, with four hundred men and several women and children.
He and his brother officer, General Rigaud (the latter being
eighty years old), were received with stately courtesy by
Lafitte, who assisted them greatly in their preparations for
the journey to the place chosen for their colony.</p>
<p>This was on the banks of the Trinity River, about sixty miles
from its mouth. When all was ready the two generals, with
one hundred men, traveled thither by land; the others set out
by water with a number of small boats carrying provisions,
ammunition, etc.</p>
<p>After several days&rsquo; march the land party reached its destination,
where the boats should have arrived before them. The
boats were not there. Lallemand and his men were already
without food, as they had started with an insufficient supply.
They began to suffer the pangs of hunger, filled at the same
time with anxiety about the missing boats. While in this condition
they found in the woods around a sort of wild lettuce,
large quantities of which they boiled and ate. No sooner had
they eaten than they were seized with violent and deathlike
convulsions. Lallemand, Rigaud, and one of the surgeons
had not tasted the poisonous herb. But they were powerless
to help, the medicines being on the boats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Thus they were in despair when a Coushatti Indian, drawn
by curiosity, came into the camp. He looked with amazement
at the ninety-seven men stretched out and apparently dying on
the ground. Lallemand, showing him the fatal herb, explained
to him by signs what had happened. The Indian sprang
swift as an arrow into the forest, and in a short time reappeared,
his arms filled with a feather-like weed. It was the
antidote of the poison the men had eaten; he boiled and made
a drink of it; and, thanks to his skill and kindness, they all
recovered.</p>
<p>Some days later the boats arrived. The voyagers had been
unable at first to find the mouth of the river, hence the
delay.</p>
<p>The colonists went to work with a will upon their settlement.
They built four small forts,&mdash;Forts Charles and Henry, Middle
Fort, and Fort Palanqua,&mdash;mounted eight cannons, and hoisted
the French flag. Then they busied themselves with their own
houses and fields.</p>
<p>They were very happy, these self-exiled French people.
They labored in their fields and gardens by day; at night they
sang and danced and made merry, looking forward to long and
peaceful lives in their new home.</p>
<p>But the grain was hardly ripe in their fields when word
came that Spanish soldiers from San Antonio and Goliad
(La Bahia) were marching upon them to destroy them, or to
drive them out of the country. They were not strong enough
to resist such a force, so they abandoned their cabins and
smiling gardens and returned to Galveston. A violent storm
swept over the island a few days after their arrival there.
Lafitte lost two brigs, three schooners, and a felucca; the
unfortunate colonists lost not only their boats, but all their
clothing and supplies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Lafitte gave them the <i>San Antonio</i>, a small ship captured
from the Spaniards, and provided them with food and clothes.
Some of them sailed to New Orleans in the <i>San Antonio</i>;
others made their way overland to Nacogdoches; thence to
Natchitoches, to Baton Rouge, and at length to New Orleans,
whence by the kindness of the citizens they were able to get
back to France.</p>
<h3 id="c14">6. A TREACHEROUS SHOT.</h3>
<p>It was but a few months after Lafitte had so generously
aided Lallemand and his colonists, when James Gaines, sent
by General Long, came to the island. Lafitte entertained him
royally at the Red House, but declined to join Long&rsquo;s enterprise.
He thought a Texas republic could be established only
by the help of a large army, whereas General Long had but a
handful of soldiers.</p>
<p>When Long received Lafitte&rsquo;s reply he started to the island
himself, in the hope of changing this decision. But hearing
from his wife that a Spanish force under Colonel Perez was
moving upon his outposts, he hurried back to Nacogdoches.
He found that place deserted; everybody had fled panic-stricken
across the Sabine at the approach of the Spaniards.
In the meantime Perez attacked the forts on the Brazos and
the Trinity, completely routing the garrisons. David Long was
among the killed.</p>
<p>General Long&rsquo;s spirit was unshaken. He joined his brave
wife on the east side of the Sabine, and made his way with
her to Bolivar Point, where the few followers left to him were
encamped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Just at this time Lafitte was ordered by the United States
government to leave the island; his pirates had begun to
meddle with American ships. He felt that resistance would
be useless; so he gathered his men together, gave them each
a handsome sum of money, and, having set fire to his fort and
town, he sailed away in <i>The Pride</i>, with sixty of his buccaneers
and a choice crew. He cruised for some years off the coast of
Yucatan, and died at Sisal in 1826.</p>
<p>It was long believed that he buried fabulous treasures&mdash;gold,
silver, and jewels&mdash;both at Grand Terre and at Galveston,
but these treasures have never been found. There is a legend
among superstitious people at Grand Terre which declares that
several times swarthy, dark-bearded strangers have appeared
there and dug in a certain place for the buried treasure. They
have succeeded each time in uncovering a great iron chest;
but as they were about to lift it out, some one has each time
spoken, and at the sound the box instantly disappeared. It
can be found and removed, the gossips add, only in the midst
of perfect silence.</p>
<p>A prettier story is told of the treasure buried at Galveston.
This story goes that on the night before he left the island
forever, the pirate chief was heard to murmur, as he paced up
and down the hall of the Red House: &ldquo;I have buried my
treasure under the three trees. In the shadow of the three lone
trees I have buried my treasure.&rdquo; Two of his men overheard
him. They stole away down the beach, with picks and spades,
determined to possess themselves of their leader&rsquo;s treasure,
which they knew must be priceless. They reached the spot,
and in the pale moonlight they found the stake set to mark the
hiding place. They shoveled the sand away, breathless and
eager with greed. At length they found a long wooden box
whose cover they pried open. Within, instead of piles of silver,
caskets of jewels, and heaps of golden doubloons, they saw
with awe and amazement the pale face and rigid form of the
Chief&rsquo;s beautiful young wife, who had died the day before.
This was the treasure of Lafitte!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>General Long watched the ships of Lafitte vanish into the
distance; then, determined as ever to carry out his plans, he
left his wife and a small guard in the fort at Bolivar Point
(July, 1821), and went with fifty-two soldiers to Goliad, which
he occupied without opposition. Three days later a troop of
Mexican cavalry entered Goliad. Long surrendered and was
sent a prisoner of war to Mexico. Eight months afterward he
was released; but almost at the moment of his release he was
shot and instantly killed by a Mexican soldier.</p>
<p>The guard left at the fort at Bolivar Point soon abandoned
it in despair. Mrs. Long refused to go with them; she had
promised her husband, she said, to await his return, and she
stayed on. Her only companions were her two little children
and a negro girl. The days passed drearily; summer died
into fall, and fall into winter. The provisions gave out, and
the forlorn little group almost perished from hunger. Several
times the Carankawaes attacked the fort. The courageous
woman loaded the cannon and fired upon the Indians, thus
keeping them at bay. In the spring of 1822 she learned
from some of Austin&rsquo;s colonists of her husband&rsquo;s tragic death.
Then only, having fulfilled her wifely trust, she left the fort.</p>
<h3 id="c15">7. A VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS.</h3>
<p>In Nacogdoches there is a wonderful elm, a tree which stood
in the primeval forest perhaps before the foot of the white man
ever trod its paths. Its leafy branches toss in the wind, green
and beautiful against the blue sky. Its old trunk has turned
into sap for its own growth the sunshine of more years than
any living man can remember.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>As a springing sapling it may have greeted Hernando de
Soto on his westward march. It may have looked down on
La Salle journeying through the forest to his untimely death;
and on Tonti of the Iron Hand, seeking tidings of his murdered
friend. Don Ramon, lying in its shade, may have watched the
slow building of the Mission of Our Lady of Nacogdoches;
and St. Denis, riding by, may have paused to cut switches from
its down-drooping branches. Nolan, Herrera, Magee, Long,
many a soldier, and many an Indian chief in his war-paint and
feathers,&mdash;all these the old tree has seen come and go.</p>
<p>A soldier of another sort stood in its shade one day in 1821,
and looked upon the small yet motley group of people gathered
about him. There were a dozen or more frontiersmen, bronzed
and bearded, and armed to the teeth; there were a few Mexican
soldiers, a Mexican woman or two with coarse mantillas on
their heads, and several wide-eyed Mexican children. The
man facing this group held a small book in his hand. He was
not armed. His eyes shone with a soft light, and when he
spoke his voice was full and sweet.</p>
<p>This was the Rev. Henry Stephenson, a Methodist preacher
who had come into the wilderness, not to found a republic nor
to set up a free and independent state, but to preach the gospel
and to make straight the paths of the Lord.</p>
<p>That day, under the old elm, the first Protestant sermon was
preached in Texas. At its close a sweet old hymn, which
many a man present had learned at his mother&rsquo;s knee, was
begun by the preacher, and one by one, and at first half
ashamed, the bearded frontiersmen took up the strain until it
floated up and away beyond the clustering leaves of the old
tree, and soared into heaven.</p>
<p>Eyes long unused to tears were wet when the hymn was
ended; and with softened hearts the singers pressed about the
man of God to bid him good-bye. For he was on his way to
carry the gospel to the utmost western border of Texas.</p>
<p>Even the gentle Mexican women joined in the cheer which
followed him as he entered the lonely forest and passed on out
of sight.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line3"><span class="smaller">(1820-1835.)</span></span></h2>
<h3 id="c16">1. AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.</h3>
<p>Moses Austin, a rugged and travel-stained American, was
walking slowly across the plaza in San Antonio one day in
December, 1820. His head hung on his breast, and his eyes
were full of trouble and defeat. Suddenly he heard his name
pronounced; he turned to find
himself face to face with the
Baron de Bastrop, who grasped
him warmly by the hand. His
eyes brightened with pleasure
at this unexpected meeting. &ldquo;I
thought myself a total stranger
in San Antonio,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>De Bastrop, whom he had met
some years before in the United
States, listened with great interest
while Austin told the story of
his plans and their failure.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic15">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="472" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Stephen Fuller Austin.</p>
</div>
<p>He was, he said, a citizen of
Missouri, where he had settled
when that state was Spanish territory. His object in coming
to San Antonio was to obtain permission to establish a colony
somewhere in Texas. But on presenting himself to Governor
Martinez (Mar-tee&prime;ness), after his long and dangerous journey,
he had been coldly received and ordered to quit the province.
He was at that moment on his way to the place where he had
left his horses and his negro servant, in order to prepare for
departure. &ldquo;My journey, as you see,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;has
been fruitless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>De Bastrop,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> a Prussian in the service of Mexico, chanced
also to be one of the alcaldes of San Antonio. &ldquo;Come with me
again to the governor,&rdquo; he said, leading the way to the official
residence. Here he used his influence to such purpose that in a
few days Austin was on his way to Missouri with the assurance
that his request would be granted by the general government.</p>
<p>But the homeward journey, made in the dead of winter,
proved fatal to him. A sickness, brought on by cold and
exposure, so weakened him that he died soon after reaching
home. Before his death, however, he learned that permission
had been given him to settle three hundred families in Texas.
He left as a sacred legacy to his son Stephen the duty of
carrying out his cherished project.</p>
<p>Stephen Fuller Austin, the great pioneer of Texas colonists,
was at that time twenty-eight years of age. He was slender
and broad-browed, with features which showed at once the gentleness
and the firmness of his character. He had inherited
his father&rsquo;s self-reliance and energy&mdash;the capital most needed
in that almost trackless wilderness henceforth to be his home.
He was well educated; his manners were courteous and dignified;
he inspired with confidence and respect all who came in
touch with him. Such, in part, was the man one day to be
known as the Father of Texas.</p>
<p>He was in New Orleans, busied about his father&rsquo;s affairs,
when he heard of the arrival at Natchitoches of Don Erasmo
Seguin, the commissioner sent from Mexico to meet and confer
with Moses Austin. He went to Natchitoches without delay,
and there learned of his father&rsquo;s death and the solemn obligation
laid upon himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>He accepted the charge without hesitation, and began at
once to perfect his plans.</p>
<p>In July he accompanied Seguin back to San Antonio, traveling
by the Old San Antonio Road. Martinez received him
kindly, and gave him permission to explore the country and
select a place for his colony. He chose the rich lands lying
between the Colorado and Brazos Rivers.</p>
<p>A contract was made which allowed 640 acres of land to
each colonist; to his wife (if married), 320 acres; and 140
acres to each child; 80 acres were allowed to the master for
each slave. The colonists, who must be from Louisiana, were
required to furnish certificates of good character, to profess the
Roman Catholic religion, and to swear allegiance to Spain.
They were to be free from taxation for six years. Austin was
commissioned to take charge of the local government.</p>
<p>These writings signed, Austin returned to Louisiana to
collect emigrants.</p>
<h3 id="c17">2. UPS AND DOWNS.</h3>
<p>It was during the Christmas holidays of 1821 that the first
settlers, led by Austin in person, reached the Brazos River and
made their camp upon the chosen spot. Their Christmas and
New Year&rsquo;s dinners were not composed of dainties, we may be
sure; but there was, no doubt, joyous roasting of wild game
over the glowing camp-fires, and there was good honest fun
and innocent merriment in plenty among these first Texans!</p>
<p>Their leader left them at once and proceeded to Matagorda
Bay to meet the <i>Lively</i>, a small schooner which had been sent
out from New Orleans with supplies for the settlement. She
had also carried eighteen colonists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The <i>Lively</i> had not arrived, nor was she ever heard of afterward.
It is supposed that she was lost at sea, with all on
board. To add to Austin&rsquo;s disappointment, some provisions
brought on a former voyage of the <i>Lively</i>, and hidden in the
canebrakes on the banks of the Brazos, had been stolen by
the Carankawae Indians. He returned empty-handed to his
people.</p>
<p>They were in no wise cast down by the news he brought.
They were already making clearings, cutting down trees, burning
underbrush, building cabins, and laying off fields. They
were at the same time obliged to keep guard day and night
against the Indians who prowled about, always on the lookout
for a chance to steal or to murder.</p>
<p>Austin, cheered by their courage, set out for San Antonio to
report to Governor Martinez. There he learned that a revolution
against Spain had taken place in Mexico. His contracts,
in the new order of things, might be worthless. He therefore
journeyed on to the city of Mexico, twelve hundred miles distant.
Much of the way he traveled with but one companion.
The country was full of robbers and cut-throats, and, in order
to escape their clutches, the two men disguised themselves as
beggars, going on foot, sleeping in the open air, and eating the
coarsest food. He found the country in such a tumult that it
was over a year before he could get his grant renewed and
return to his colony.</p>
<p>Meantime, other settlers had come in, some making their
way slowly by land with ox-teams, stopping sometimes for a
whole season to raise and harvest a crop of corn, and then
moving patiently on. &ldquo;Children were born in these movers&rsquo;
camps,&rdquo; says one writer, &ldquo;and the dead were buried by the
roadside.&rdquo; Others came in ships from New Orleans and
Mobile, and even from the far New England coast. In 1822
the <i>Revenge</i> and the <i>Only Son</i> came into Galveston harbor and
landed at Bolivar Point over a hundred immigrants. They
found Mrs. Long in the forlorn little fort where her husband
had left her, still waiting and hoping for his return. It was
from these pitying and kind-hearted pioneers that the heroic
wife learned of the assassination of her husband. In their
company she and her children left the place of so much
suffering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>The first crop of corn&mdash;turned into the virgin soil with
wooden ploughs&mdash;had been gathered; a little cotton had
whitened the patches about the cabin doors, and the spinning-wheels
were already busy. The familiar low of home-returning
milch-cows was heard at sundown along the winding footpaths.
One of the settlers (Randall Jones) had gone to Louisiana,
taking with him a negro lad. There he traded the boy for
sixty head of cattle, which he drove across the country to the
settlement. Another colonist brought out some pigs and a few
goats. These domestic animals gave a homelike appearance
to the strange land.</p>
<p>The settlement was thriving in spite of hardships. But these
hardships were almost without number. There was neither
salt, coffee, nor sugar. Meat was to be had only by hunting,
and oftentimes deer and buffalo were hard to find and, on
account of the Indians, dangerous to follow. True, there were
great numbers of wild mustangs.</p>
<p>There were no horses in America before the discovery of
Columbus. The Texas mustangs were the product of the
cavalry horses brought from Europe to Mexico by Cortez in
1519. They had multiplied, almost unmolested, during the
three hundred years they had roamed prairie and forest.
These mustangs were always fat, and when nothing better was
to be had they made tolerable food.</p>
<p>There were, of course, no stores where anything could be
bought; the men went dressed in buckskin; the women in
coarse cloth woven by themselves. There was no mail, news
from the outer world&mdash;from the dear ones left behind in the
far-away &ldquo;states&rdquo;&mdash;came only when a chance traveler arrived
with an old newspaper or possibly a letter in his saddle bags.
There was neither school nor church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>But in those rude cabins dwelt honesty, high courage, and
unbounded hospitality. In business every man&rsquo;s &ldquo;word was
as good as his bond.&rdquo; There were no locks on the doors,
robbery being unknown. Everything, even to life itself, was
ever at the service of friend and neighbor. The nameless
traveler, welcomed without question, shared, as long as he
chose to stay, the fireside and table of his host.</p>
<p>Of such stuff were the first Texans.</p>
<p>Austin returned from Mexico in July, 1823. He was
welcomed with affectionate joy by his colonists. He was
accompanied by his father&rsquo;s friend, the Baron de Bastrop,
commissioned by the government to assist him in laying off
the town, surveying lands, and issuing titles.</p>
<p>The town was named by Se&ntilde;or de la Garza, who had succeeded
Martinez as governor of Texas. He called it San
Felipe (Fa-lee&prime;p&#257;) de Austin, in honor at the same time of his
own patron saint and of its founder.</p>
<p>Other towns soon sprung up over the province; for grants
for other settlements had been sought and obtained from the
government. Austin got permission in 1825 to bring out five
hundred additional families. Immigrants flocked in, eager to
share in this cheap and fruitful paradise. The names <i>Columbia</i>,
<i>Brazoria</i>, <i>Gonzales</i>, <i>Victoria</i>, <i>San Augustine</i>, and other towns
and settlements, began to be familiar to the tongue.</p>
<p>Some Irish colonists founded on the Nueces River, near its
mouth, a town which they named St. Patrick in remembrance of
the patron saint of Ireland. To the Spanish-speaking people
of Texas it soon became known as San Patricio, and so it is
still called.</p>
<p>A large tract of land was granted to Hayden Edwards, a Kentuckian,
in the neighborhood of Nacogdoches, the old gateway
of Texas history. But things did not go as smoothly there as in
Austin&rsquo;s colony. It was too near the Neutral Ground, which continued
to harbor outlaws and adventurers of all kinds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The land, moreover, was claimed by the Mexicans and others
who were already settled upon it. The quarrels between these
and the newcomers became in course of time so bitter that the
Mexican government, during an absence of Hayden Edwards
in the United States, took back his grant and ordered him and
his two brothers to leave the country.</p>
<p>Edwards had put all of his private fortune into his venture,
and this act of tyranny goaded him and his colonists to fury.
Finding vain all their appeals to the governor, they took up
arms and declared they would make of Texas an independent
republic. They called themselves Fredonians; and banding
together, they entrenched themselves in the old stone fort at
Nacogdoches. Thence they sent an appeal to Austin&rsquo;s colonists
for help. Both Austin&rsquo;s colonists and the Cherokee
Indians, upon whom they counted for support, refused to join
them. News came that a Mexican army was marching against
them; their own fighting force was less than two hundred men.
They saw the weakness of their position; and the Fredonian
war, as it was called, ended after a skirmish or two, in the
surrender of the Fredonians. Edwards and his colonists left
Texas, and returned angry and disgusted to Louisiana (1826).</p>
<p>This was a small foretaste of Mexican justice. But troubles
far graver than the Fredonian war were at that moment brewing
for Texas.</p>
<h3 id="c18">3. ORDERS AND DISORDER.</h3>
<p>Until 1824 Texas had been a province of Mexico, with her
capital at San Antonio. In that year, however, the general
government decreed the union of Texas with Coahuila; and
the capital of the new state was fixed at Saltillo (Sal-tee&prime;yo), a
distant town in Mexico. A department chief was the only
official stationed at San Antonio. The colonists were much
displeased at this change. Instead of a ride, when necessary,
to San Antonio, where there were friends and familiar faces,
torch-lit plazas, music, and <i>fiestas</i> to welcome the traveler, it
meant a long and perilous journey through a strange land,
among people who regarded all Americans with an eye of sullen
distrust.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The Mexicans can hardly be blamed for their lack of confidence.
They had just shaken off the yoke of Spain; and they
saw the Americans&mdash;people of a different race, speaking a
different tongue, strong, energetic, and masterful&mdash;drawing
daily nearer to the Rio Grande River. They saw this alien
people settling upon rich and productive lands, but paying no
taxes; giving nominal allegiance to the Mexican government,
but taking no interest in her political affairs. Added to this
uneasiness was a growing hatred of the United States, which
wished to annex Texas and had already offered to buy the
province. Mexico resolved to crush this rising power.</p>
<p>The Americans, on their side, were restless. They did not
desire absolute independence; but they wished for a separate
state within the Mexican Republic. They therefore, for
political as well as for personal reasons, resented the change
of capital.</p>
<p>Still further changes were at hand. Bustamente (Boos-ta-men&prime;t&#257;),
a cruel and overbearing man, who became President of
Mexico in 1830, on taking his seat issued a set of laws forbidding
Americans either to locate in Texas or to trade with
her people. In place of colonists from the United States,
criminals and disabled soldiers from Mexico were to settle the
country. The introduction of slaves was prohibited; taxes
were put upon almost everything in daily use; customhouses
were established for the collection of these duties; armed
troops were quartered in different places at the expense of the
colonists; and military rules were enforced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>It is needless to say that these laws were not obeyed. Texas
was like a nest of angry hornets whose center of action was
at San Felipe; a buzz of indignation filled the air; meetings
were everywhere held to protest against the injustice and tyranny
of Mexico.</p>
<p>The excitement was increased by the arrest and imprisonment
of some Texans (1832) by Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn,
an American in command of the Mexican Fort Anahuac (An-ah&prime;wak)
on Galveston Bay. Among these were William B.
Travis (the future hero of the Alamo) and Patrick Jack. William
Jack, a brother of the latter, called a meeting at San
Felipe, where it was determined to resort to arms, if necessary,
for the release of the prisoners, whose offense was trifling.</p>
<p>The state of feeling was clearly shown by the number of
men who declared themselves ready to join in attacking Bradburn
in his fort. The affair, however, was settled without
bloodshed. Colonel Piedras, the Mexican commandant at
Nacogdoches, hastened to Fort Anahuac. There, after an
investigation of the case, he released the prisoners and placed
Bradburn himself under arrest.</p>
<p>In the meantime a fight had taken place between the Mexican
garrison at Fort Velasco, at the mouth of the Brazos River, and
one hundred and twelve Texans, who had been aroused by the
tyranny of Bradburn. Not one of these Texans had ever
before been in a battle; their coolness and bravery under fire
gave them the measure of their own power. They were victorious.
Colonel Dominic Ugartechea (U-gar-t&#257;-ch&#257;&prime;a), the
commandant of the fort, whose personal courage won the
admiration of the Texans, surrendered, with a loss of thirty-five
killed and thirteen wounded. Of the Texans seven were
killed and twenty-seven wounded.</p>
<p>These encounters increased the public excitement to frenzy.
But the excitement was suddenly allayed by news from Mexico.
The patriot Santa Anna had &ldquo;pronounced&rdquo; (declared) against
Bustamente.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Santa Anna at this time was looked upon in his own country
as a patriot; he had been a leader during the war with the
Spanish royalists, and active in deposing Iturbide (Ee-toor-bee&prime;d&#257;)
(1822) when that officer had crowned himself Emperor
of Mexico. He had always professed great love for the Texas
colonists; and now his bold stand against Bustamente gave
assurance that the rights of the colonists would thenceforth be
respected. The Texans were wild with enthusiasm, and they
gladly pledged their support to
Santa Anna, the &ldquo;generous
and high-minded patriot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Anna was elected
President of Mexico. His
disposition towards Texas continued
so friendly that it seemed
a good time to make an appeal
to his government for a separation
of the state of Texas from
Coahuila.</p>
<p>A convention met at San
Felipe in April, 1833. Delegates
were present from all the
districts. The streets of the
little town on the Brazos echoed under the tread of men who
were afterwards to write their names in the Republic&rsquo;s book of
gold. Sam Houston, the future hero of San Jacinto, was
present as a delegate; David G. Burnet, who was to become
the first President of the Republic of Texas; Erasmo Seguin;
William H. Wharton; Branch T. Archer; and Stephen F.
Austin, the Father of Texas.</p>
<p>A constitution was framed, and a memorial was written to the
general government, asking for separation from Coahuila and
the repeal of Bustamente&rsquo;s odious decrees.</p>
<p>Austin carried these papers to the Mexican congress. His
breast swelled with hope as he drew near the city of Mexico
and the &ldquo;high-minded patriot&rdquo; Santa Anna.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic16">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="584" />
<p class="caption">Santa Anna.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>But the Vice-President, Gomez Farias, had no time to listen
to so trifling a thing as a memorial from Texas colonists. As
for President Santa Anna, he was shut up in his country-house
(Manga de Clavo) laying plans for overthrowing the Mexican
constitution and making himself dictator.</p>
<p>Sick at heart over his vain attempts to get a hearing from
the government, Austin started home. But a letter which he
had written to Texas, advising the people to organize a separate
state without further appeal to Mexico, had been sent back to
Farias as a treasonable document. Austin was arrested at
Saltillo, taken back to the city of Mexico, and put in prison,
where he remained for nearly two years. A part of that time
he was in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>During his imprisonment he kept a diary. He says of himself
on one of these loose pencil-written leaves: &ldquo;In my first
exploring trip in Texas, in 1821, I had a very good old man
with me, who had been raised on the frontier, and was a very
good hunter. We had not been many days in the wilderness
before he told me: &lsquo;You are too impatient to make a hunter.&rsquo;
Scarce a day passed that he did not say to me: &lsquo;You are too
impatient&mdash;you wish to go too fast.&rsquo; Before my trip was
ended I saw the benefit of his maxim, and I determined to
adopt it as a rule in settling the colony which I was then about
to commence in Texas.... I believe the greatest error I ever
committed was in departing from that rule as I did in the city
of Mexico in October, 1833. I lost patience at the delays in
getting the business of Texas dispatched, and in a moment of
impatience wrote an imprudent, and perhaps an intemperate,
letter to the council at San Antonio.&rdquo; &ldquo;How happy,&rdquo; he
says in another place, &ldquo;how happy I could have been on a
farm, ... free from all the cares and difficulties that now
surround me. But I thought it was my duty to obey the call
of the people and go to Mexico as their agent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>In October, 1834, he was admitted to a conference with
Santa Anna, who promised to &ldquo;meditate maturely&rdquo; the repeal
of some of Bustamente&rsquo;s laws. He expressed so much love
for Texas that Austin wrote to his people in a burst of thankfulness,
&ldquo;All is going well.&rdquo; But he was himself still detained,
and it was not until September, 1835, that he was allowed to
return to Texas.</p>
<p>The Texans, despite Austin&rsquo;s letter of assurance, knew that
all was not going well. They were, in fact, so convinced that
all was going ill that they met in the different towns and
organized committees of safety for protection against the
Indians (who had become very troublesome), and to take
charge of all public matters. At a meeting held in San Felipe
October 1, 1834, it was openly proposed to make Texas a
separate state without the consent of Mexico. But this step
was for a time postponed.</p>
<p>The next year the situation was still more gloomy. Santa
Anna&rsquo;s congress passed a decree disarming all Texans. General
Martin Perfecto de Cos was ordered from Mexico to
Texas with a body of five hundred soldiers to enforce the
decree, and to punish those who had refused to obey, not the
just laws of the Mexican Republic, but the tyrannical edicts of
Bustamente and Santa Anna.</p>
<p>At the same time a courier was arrested with dispatches
from Ugartechea at San Antonio to the commandant at
Anahuac. These dispatches were opened and read at San
Felipe. They stated that a strong force would soon reach
Anahuac from Mexico.</p>
<p>These things caused great uneasiness and indignation.
Another meeting was held in San Felipe. Among those who
addressed the people there assembled was R. M. Williamson
(called three-legged Willie, because of his carrying a crutch).
He counseled resistance. &ldquo;Our country, our property, our
liberty, and our lives,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are all involved in the
present contest between the states and the military.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>In the midst of the excitement Austin reached home. He
was welcomed almost as one given up by the tomb.</p>
<p>It was determined to hold a general consultation to consider
the dangers threatening Texas.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; was used instead of &ldquo;convention&rdquo; to
avoid exciting the jealousy of the government. A convention
in Mexico was often followed by a revolution.</p>
<p>A call was issued by Austin for the election of delegates, and
the time and place of meeting were fixed for October 16 at
San Felipe.</p>
<h3 id="c19">4. A TRUMPET CALL.</h3>
<p>A messenger came riding into San Felipe one day; his
clothes were dusty, his horse was flecked with foam, his voice
was hoarse with excitement. He had ridden hard and fast
from Gonzales town, and the news he brought thrilled to the
heart&rsquo;s core the men who had gathered about him in the plaza.</p>
<p>Colonel Ugartechea, acting under the decree disarming
citizens, had sent an order to Gonzales for a cannon&mdash;a four-pounder
given by the Mexican government to the townspeople
in 1831 for service against the Indians. The order had been
peremptorily refused. There were only eighteen men at Gonzales,
but they determined to hold the cannon at any cost;
and believing that Ugartechea would send an armed force to
take it, they had dispatched messengers to the Colorado, the
Guadalupe, and the Brazos for help.</p>
<p>The messenger to San Felipe had not finished his story
before the men were in their saddles, or girded for the long
tramp. They were already armed for the purpose of intercepting
General Cos on his march to San Antonio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>When they reached Gonzales they found that the Mexican
captain Castenado, had appeared there (September 29) with
one hundred cavalrymen and made his demand for the cannon.
He had been put off with the pretext that the alcalde was
absent, thus giving the volunteers time to arrive.</p>
<p>The Mexicans had remained on the west bank of the
Guadalupe River, the ferryboats having been removed by the
Texans to the east or town side on the approach of the enemy.</p>
<p>With the recruits from the Brazos, the Colorado, and the
Guadalupe, the Texans on the 30th numbered one hundred and
sixty fighting men.
They then informed
Castenado
that he could not
have the cannon.
Moreover, Major
Williamson (three-legged
Willie) and
some others drew
the disputed piece
of artillery to the
river-bank, and
placed above it a
placard bearing in
large letters the
challenge, &ldquo;Come
and Take It.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic17">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="564" />
<p class="caption">R. M. Williamson.</p>
</div>
<p>In response to
this taunt Castenado
made an effort to cross his troops over the river; but the
fords were too well guarded, and he finally moved away and
encamped a short distance from the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>On the evening of the 1st of October the Texans, under the
command of Colonels John Moore and J. W. Wallace, crossed
the Guadalupe, carrying their four-pounder with them. The
same night at eleven o&rsquo;clock they were formed into a hollow
Square. Colonels Moore and Wallace, with the Rev. W. P.
Smith, rode into the square, where the minister, being seated
on his favorite mule, made them a spirited address. &ldquo;Fellow
soldiers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the cause for which we are contending is
just, honorable, and glorious&mdash;our liberty.... Let us march
silently, obey the commands of our superior officers, and, united
as one man, present a bold front to the enemy. <i>Victory will
be ours.</i>&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>On the morning of the 2d they advanced under cover of a
heavy fog to a high mound in the prairie where the enemy was
posted. After the exchange of a few picket shots a parley
took place between Colonel Moore and Captain Castenado.
But they could come to no agreement, so they returned to their
respective commands. The Texans at once opened fire with
their saucy little cannon, and in a short time the enemy was put
to rout. The Mexicans retreated toward San Antonio, having
lost several men. The Texans, without the loss of a man,
returned in triumph to Gonzales with their precious cannon.</p>
<p>This was the first trumpet call to the war of independence.
The alarm leaped from town to town. Texas, like a trooper
who stands with his foot in the stirrup awaiting but the blast
of a bugle, sprang at once into action. There was everywhere
an eager note of preparation.</p>
<p>A few days after the victory at Gonzales, Captain George
Collingsworth, with about fifty planters from Caney and Matagorda,
marched from the latter place to capture Goliad. Just
about midnight on the 9th of October, as they approached the
town, they were hailed by a man who came out of a mesquit
thicket on the roadside. It was Benjamin Milam. He had
escaped from prison in Monterey, where he had been placed
for opposing the tyranny of Santa Anna, and, worn out by his
long journey, he had thrown himself on the ground to rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Milam was a man of high courage and stern patriotism. He
had taken part&mdash;always on the republican side&mdash;in several
of the bloody revolutions in Mexico, and he had been in almost
every prison from the Rio Grande to the city of Mexico.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>He offered his services to the little band of patriots. They
welcomed him with joy into their ranks.</p>
<p>They marched on, and during the night fell upon the unsuspecting
garrison at Goliad. The sentinel who fired upon them
was killed. The commandant Colonel Sandoval was taken
prisoner in his own room, the door of which was broken open
with axes. Several officers and twenty-five private soldiers
surrendered, the others having escaped in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>. The
spoils which fell into the hands of the Texans by this exploit
were very valuable. They consisted of three hundred stands
of arms, several cannon, and about ten thousand dollars worth
of military stores.</p>
<h3 id="c20">5. OUT OF A MIST.</h3>
<p>San Felipe was not behindhand in enthusiasm over the
tidings from Gonzales. Delegates to the General Consultation
were coming in, and the committee, on hearing the news,
sent out a circular calling upon each man in Texas to decide
for himself whether or not he would submit to the tyranny of
Mexico, and if he would not submit, &ldquo;let him answer by mouth
of his rifle.&rdquo; This charge was not needed. Men poured in
from every quarter carrying their rifles, shot-pouches, and
powder-horns; the look of grim determination on their faces
meant &ldquo;liberty, or war to the death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Austin, by permission of the convention, left San Felipe for
Gonzales, arriving there on the 10th of October. He was
elected to the command of the volunteers there assembled,
about three hundred and fifty strong, and marched almost
immediately for San Antonio, hoping to capture and hold that
important post. He encamped on the 20th at the Mission of
La Espada on the San Antonio River. Recruits came in
rapidly. Sam Houston, who had given his last five-dollar bill
to a messenger to spread the call for volunteers, arrived with a
detachment of men from East Texas. Bowie and Travis,
Crockett and Fannin, Milam, Burleson, &ldquo;Deaf&rdquo; Smith, Rusk,
Wharton,&mdash;these gathered in groups about the camp, little
dreaming that each man of them carried within his own breast
something of which the history of Texas was to be made.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic18">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="422" />
<p class="caption">Mission of La Espada.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>General Cos had arrived and had taken command at San
Antonio. He scornfully rejected Austin&rsquo;s summons to surrender,
even threatening to fire upon his flag of truce. Austin,
whose army now numbered about six hundred men, did not
feel himself strong enough to make an attack, but decided to
move nearer the enemy. Accordingly on the 27th he sent
Captains Bowie and Fannin with ninety-two men to reconnoiter
and to choose a suitable position. They marched up the riverbank
and encamped at nightfall in a bend of the river, near the
old Mission of Concepcion.</p>
<p>The next morning at sunrise, through the mist that hung like
a grey curtain around the camp, they heard something like the
wary tread of horses&rsquo; hoofs. At the same time a sentinel<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a>
posted in the high tower of the mission gave warning, and a
shot echoed from the outer picket-line.</p>
<p>The Texans sprang to arms; a slight lifting of the fog
showed them a solid phalanx of Mexican cavalry hemming in
the camp on three sides. There was a breathless interval of
preparation, but no confusion; and by the time the enemy&rsquo;s
infantry came in sight trailing their arms, the Texans were ready
for the fight. It was a short and sharp one.</p>
<p>The encampment had been well chosen; the triangular
bottom land in which it lay by the riverside was skirted by
heavy timber, and the bluff surrounding it made a sort of
natural parapet.</p>
<p>In a few moments the Mexicans shoved forth their cannon,&mdash;a
brass six-pounder,&mdash;and their bugle sounded a cavalry charge.
But one set of gunners after another fell dead or wounded
around the cannon, and the cavalry was beaten back. Finally,
by a sudden impulse, the whole body of Texans rushed forward
with the cry, &ldquo;The cannon and victory!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The battle had lasted thirty minutes. The Texan loss was
one man (Richard Andrews) killed; none wounded. The
Mexicans, whose force numbered four hundred, had sixty
killed and about as many wounded. These, in the pell-mell
retreat of the attacking party, were left upon the field. About
noon a white flag was seen coming across the prairie. It was
carried by a priest sent by General Cos, who asked and obtained
permission to bury the dead.</p>
<p>The main army, which had marched from La Espada on
hearing the cannon, arrived after the battle was over.</p>
<p>Some days later Austin camped with his troops near San
Antonio, and prepared to hold his position until strong enough
to storm the place.</p>
<p>But inaction, after the brilliant successes at Gonzales, Goliad,
and Concepcion, was galling to the volunteers. They clamored
to be allowed to throw themselves against Cos&rsquo; fortifications,
and when they were held back many of them grew dissatisfied
and left the army. Those who remained were cheered by the
arrival of the Grays&mdash;two fine companies of volunteers from
New Orleans&mdash;and a company from Mississippi.</p>
<p>Another incident which revived their drooping spirits was a
lively skirmish on the morning of November 26. The approach
of a train of mules from Mexico, loaded with silver for General
Cos, had been reported by spies to General Edward Burleson,
then in command of the army. Colonel Bowie with a small
scouting party was on the watch for its appearance.</p>
<p>A scout riding up reported about two hundred Mexican
cavalry advancing from the west, guarding a number of loaded
pack-mules. Bowie sent the scout on to Burleson for assistance,
and dashed forward with his men to cut off the train.
On his approach the Mexican cavalry posted themselves in a
ravine about one mile from San Antonio. Bowie charged them,
but at that moment he was attacked in the rear by a body of
Mexican soldiers, who, seeing the situation, had come out from
San Antonio, bringing two cannon with them. Bowie wheeled
and rode upon this new force, and Burleson coming up with
reinforcements, the Mexicans were put to flight, abandoning
pack-mules and packs, and leaving on the field fifty men killed
and several wounded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>When the Texans, who had come off without a scratch, threw
themselves upon the bulky packs ready to count out Mexican
dollars, they found them filled, instead, with fresh grass cut for
the feed of General Cos&rsquo; horses. This skirmish was known
as the Grass Fight.</p>
<h3 id="c21">6. THE PRIEST&rsquo;S HOUSE.</h3>
<p>While these things were happening at San Antonio, the
General Consultation was in session at San Felipe. General
Austin, appointed special commissioner to the United States,
had resigned his position as commander-in-chief of the army
two days before the Grass Fight.</p>
<p>Edward Burleson, who succeeded to the command, had fought
under General Jackson in the Creek war, and was known
throughout Texas as a brave and intrepid Indian fighter. To
him the soldiers now looked confidently for immediate action;
and all eyes were turned eagerly toward the citadel over which
floated the Mexican flag.</p>
<p>The old town beloved of St. Denis still hugged the river-bank,
buried in evergreen foliage and gay with ever-blooming flowers.
The stone and adobe houses, with flat roofs, thick walls, and
barred windows, lined the narrow streets which opened out
into the Military Plaza and the old <i>Plaza de las Islas</i> (now
Constitution). These plazas had been fortified, and the streets
leading into them were barricaded and guarded by cannon.
On the east side of the river the fortress of the Church of the
Alamo and its walled enclosure had also been fortified and
mounted with artillery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>General Burleson, aware of these fortifications, looked at the
citadel and at his little army, and, courageous though he was,
he stopped to count the cost. While he was hesitating and his
men were openly fretting, three Americans escaped from San
Antonio, where they had been imprisoned, and came into the
camp (December 3). Their report of the enemy&rsquo;s condition
decided Burleson to attack the place at once. The order was
given and a plan of assault arranged. The soldiers were jubilant;
an activity long unknown pervaded the camp. But into
the midst of this cheerful excitement dropped like a bombshell
a second order countermanding the first. A scout had disappeared,
and it was believed
that he had deserted in order
to warn Cos of the intended
attack.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic19">
<img src="images/p19.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="584" />
<p class="caption">Edward Burleson.</p>
</div>
<p>This reason did not satisfy
the soldiers. They were defiant
and angry almost to
mutiny. Their indignation
knew no bounds when they
were told that the camp was
about to be broken and the
siege raised. There was a
loud clamor of rage and disappointment.
During this
scene the missing scout returned
in company with a deserter from San Antonio, who
confirmed the report of the weakness of the defenses and the
discontent of the Mexican garrison. Benjamin Milam, upon
this, had a word or two with General Burleson in his tent; then
he stepped out, bared his head, and, waving his hat with a loud
hurrah, demanded in a ringing voice: &ldquo;Who will go with old
Ben Milam into San Antonio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three hundred volunteers with an answering shout sprang
to the front.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The same night (December 4) by twos and threes, singly,
and in squads, the storming party stole silently into an old mill
on the road between the camp and the town. Milam, the chief
in command, told them off into two divisions: one to be led by
himself and the other by Colonel Frank W. Johnson. Silent
still and like phantoms, the double line took up its march over
the intervening ground and slipped into San Antonio.</p>
<p>A little earlier, Colonel Neill had started from camp with a
detachment to make a pretended attack on the fortress of the
Alamo. He opened fire before daylight and continued to hold
the enemy&rsquo;s attention until the assaulting party could enter the
town. When the sound of their guns apprised him that this
was done, he returned to the camp, where General Burleson
kept his men under arms, ready to march at any moment to
Milam&rsquo;s assistance.</p>
<p>Milam and Johnson, guided by Deaf Smith, drew their men
swiftly through the dark and silent streets. Suddenly a sentinel
gave the alarm. A shot from Deaf Smith&rsquo;s rifle silenced him
forever; and the Texans dashed to cover. The Mexicans
poured out of their quarters and attacked them furiously in the
houses of Se&ntilde;ors de la Garza and Veramendi, where they had
taken shelter. They returned the fire with their accustomed
coolness, picking off their assailants with unerring aim through
loop-holes cut in the thick walls, or from the flat parapeted roofs.</p>
<p>For the next five days the Texans were engaged in fighting
and burrowing their way steadily toward the Military Plaza.
With cannon booming and scattering grape and canister among
them, and the rattle of small arms in their ears, they dug
trenches along the streets from corner to corner; they battered
down doors; with crowbars and axes they pried openings in
walls&mdash;fighting the while, now at long range, now in deadly
hand-to-hand encounters, and always with defiant smiles on
their powder-blackened faces. The weather was wet and cold;
the dismal streets were slippery with blood and choked with
the d&eacute;bris of battle. Above, in the smoky air flapped from the
church tower a black flag which meant &ldquo;No quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>On the third day Milam, leaping from a trench to the
entrance of the Veramendi courtyard, was killed. A volley
of shot spattered holes in the heavy, green, batten door beside
him as he fell. The brave Chieftain was buried on the spot
consecrated by his own blood. Colonel Johnson was elected
leader in his place, and the fighting and burrowing went on.
About noon the same day Henry Karnes stormed alone the
only house between de la Garza&rsquo;s and the plaza, and forced
an entrance with a crowbar under a heavy fire from the
enemy.</p>
<p>Henry Karnes, the hero of this exploit, was a trapper from
the frontier of Arkansas. He had a genuine love of Indian
warfare for its own sake, and in search of it came to Texas with
the earliest pioneers. When the trumpet call for volunteers
was sounded, he enlisted and soon came to be known, with his
celebrated friend and companion Deaf Smith, as one of the best
scouts and spies in the army. He had many adventures
among the Indians. At one time in single combat with an
Apache chief he was wounded and taken prisoner. His fiery
red hair, which the Indians supposed to be painted, caused him
to be regarded by them as a great medicine man. After his
capture they concluded to deprive him of this charm, and, taking
him to the nearest stream, they ducked his head under the
water to wash the red from his hair. When they found, after
nearly drowning him, that the red would not come off, they
released him, satisfied that he was a favorite of the Great Spirit.
He held the house he had taken, against the enraged Mexicans,
until Captain York&rsquo;s company joined him and fortified the
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These dogs of Texans are hard to beat off,&rdquo; thought General
Cos, listening to the crack of their rifles. His crafty face
lightened for one moment, for Ugartechea came in from the
Rio Grande, and entered the fortress, in spite of the cordon of
guards, with five hundred recruits. But such recruits! Cos&rsquo;
face darkened again. They were five hundred convicts chained
together two and two, and driven like sheep by their guards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>On the night of the 8th of December the Texans, by a sudden
rush and under a hail of hostile bullets, made themselves masters
of the Priest&rsquo;s House. The Priest&rsquo;s House was a large,
thick-walled building, commanding the Military Plaza on the
north side. The captors at once barricaded the doors and cut
loop-holes in the massive walls. A loud cheer carried the
news of their success to their comrades outside. &ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo;
they shouted joyously.</p>
<p>But the capture of the Priest&rsquo;s House completely demoralized
the Mexicans. On the morning of the 9th the cannon
at the Alamo ceased their thunder; the black flag was hauled
down from San Fernando&rsquo;s tower and a white one went up
in its place.</p>
<p>General Burleson entered the city the same day and arranged
with General Cos the terms of surrender.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> By these a large
quantity of valuable stores, ammunition, artillery, small arms,
and clothing remained in the hands of the victors. The Mexicans
to the number of thirteen hundred, after taking an oath
not to fight against Texas, were permitted to leave, the officers
retaining their arms and private property.</p>
<p>The Texan loss in this five days&rsquo; fight was two killed and
twenty-six wounded; the enemy lost about one hundred and
fifty.</p>
<p>General Burleson placed a small garrison in the fortress of the
Alamo. The camp was raised, and many of the Texan volunteers
scattered to their own homes and firesides, rejoicing in
the fact that not a Mexican soldier remained to tread the soil
of Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h3 id="c22">7. BY THE BRAZOS.</h3>
<p>In November, just before the fight at Concepcion, Houston,
Wharton, and other delegates left Austin&rsquo;s army to take their
seats as members of the General Consultation at San Felipe.</p>
<p>Branch T. Archer was elected President of the Consultation.</p>
<p>Many of the members were in favor of an outright declaration
of independence; but the more prudent advised against a
step so decisive. A temporary government was therefore
agreed upon, and a declaration of adherence to the Republican
constitution of Mexico of 1824 was signed and sent out.
This declaration also gave the reasons of the colonists for
taking up arms against military despotism, and stated that
&ldquo;they would not cease to carry on war as long as Mexican
troops were within the limits of Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The convention then elected Henry Smith governor, and
James W. Robinson lieutenant-governor of the provisional
government. Branch T. Archer, William H. Wharton, and
Stephen F. Austin were appointed commissioners to the
United States. Houston was made commander-in-chief of
the Texan army &ldquo;to be raised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Houston, placed in so responsible a place by the Consultation,
was born in Virginia, but removed when a child to
Tennessee with his widowed mother. He had a strong imperious
and wayward disposition which showed itself from his
early boyhood. At the age of fourteen he left home and joined
a band of Cherokee Indians, was adopted into their tribe,
learned their language, and wore their costume. In 1813 he
served under Jackson in the Creek war; and at the battle of
Topo-heka,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> he was struck in the thigh by an Indian arrow;
the barbed head buried itself deep in the flesh. He ordered
the man by his side to pull out the arrow. After two vain
attempts the man, who was the lieutenant of his company,
turned away. Houston drew his sword and commanded him
again to draw out the arrow. &ldquo;If you fail,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I
will kill you on the spot.&rdquo; The arrow on the third tug came
out, leaving a gaping wound. At this battle he received also
two bullets in his shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<div class="img" id="pic20">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="584" />
<p class="caption">Sam Houston.</p>
</div>
<p>He became in rapid turn major-general of the Tennessee
militia, member of congress, and governor of his state.
While he was governor, and
in the full splendor of his
brilliant career, he resigned
his office in consequence of
some private and domestic
trouble, which has ever remained
a secret, and took
refuge among his old friends,
the Cherokees, with whom he
dwelt for years, living the life
of an Indian warrior.</p>
<p>In 1832 he went to Washington,
D. C., in the interests
of the Cherokees, and while
there was appointed special
Indian agent for the southwest. The same year he visited
Texas. At San Felipe he met James Bowie and went with
him to San Antonio to treat with the Comanches. In 1833
he settled in San Augustine, whence he went as a delegate to
the Consultation of 1835.</p>
<p>Governor Smith and his council continued in session at San
Felipe. They provided for the raising and equipment of an
army of twelve hundred soldiers, and made arrangements for
a small navy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>In December Major William Ward of Georgia arrived at San
Felipe. He was in command of three hundred newly enlisted
volunteers, known as the Georgia Battalion. He obtained from
Governor Smith commissions for his officers and returned to
Velasco where he had left his troops. Thence they marched
to Goliad. About the same time Colonel Wyatt, with two
companies of recruits, came from Alabama; and a little later
the Red Rovers, a company from Courtland, Alabama, landed
at Matagorda. Doctor Shackleford, the captain, sent a messenger
to the governor to say that the Red Rovers placed
themselves at the service of Texas to remain, not for a term of
three, six, or twelve months, but as long as a man was left of
the company, or there was an enemy to be found on Texas
soil. This offer was accepted by the governor with gratitude,
and the Red Rovers, as well as Colonel Wyatt&rsquo;s volunteers,
were ordered to report to Colonel Fannin at Goliad.</p>
<p>Bitter quarrels, however, soon arose between Governor Smith
and his council and almost put a stop to all public business.
Governor Smith was deposed, and Lieutenant-Governor Robinson
was placed at the head of affairs. Finally, after providing
for an election for delegates to a convention to be held at
Washington on the Brazos March 1, the council adjourned.</p>
<p>About the last of March the following year (1836), the
Texans, to keep San Felipe from falling into the hands of
Santa Anna, set fire to it themselves. The flames spread from
cabin to cabin, roaring around the hearthstones so long noted
for their hospitality. They swept past the one-room building
where the conventions had been held and devoured the rude,
unchinked log-hut in the black-jack grove beyond, where Henry
Stephenson had preached, and where the first Sunday School
had been organized; they consumed roof-tree and picket and
garden-fence, so that in a few hours a heap of blackened ashes
alone remained of the cradle of Texas.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line3"><span class="smaller">(1835-1836.)</span></span></h2>
<h3 id="c23">1. MESSENGERS OF DISTRESS.</h3>
<p>On the 20th of December, 1835, there was a spirited meeting
of citizens and soldiers at the old town of La Bahia (Goliad) on
the San Antonio River.</p>
<p>La Bahia&mdash;which means &ldquo;the bay&rdquo;&mdash;was already old when
Austin laid off his town on the Brazos. Captain Alonzo de
Leon, on his way to attack La Salle at Fort St. Louis in 1689,
stopped there; and in 1718 Don Domingo Ramon with his
troopers and friars built there the Mission of Espiritu Santo
(The Holy Ghost) for the benefit of the fierce Carankawae
Indians.</p>
<p>The town had seen stirring times during the century and a
half of its existence. There had been many Indian fights in
and around the mission church, when the garrison was weak
and the priests could not control their red-skinned converts;
it was in the same church in 1812 that Magee&rsquo;s army was
besieged, and from its doors his Republicans sallied forth
to their victorious hand-to-hand conflict with the Spaniards.
Here, too, in 1819, General Long surrendered to the Mexicans
and was carried away to a treacherous death.</p>
<p>And here in October, 1835, the Mexican commandant
Sandoval had been surprised in his sleep by the Texans, his
soldiers made prisoners, and the fort and its stores handed over
to his captors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>The General Consultation at San Felipe in November, 1835,
had thought it more prudent to declare their adherence to the
Mexican republican constitution than to issue a declaration of
independence.</p>
<p>The citizens and soldiers of Goliad, on the 20th of December
following, boldly set their names to a document resolving &ldquo;that
the former state and department of Texas is and ought to be
<i>a free, sovereign, and independent state</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the signers were several boys fifteen and sixteen
years of age.</p>
<p>This paper was sent to the governor and his council at San
Felipe by whom it was disapproved and suppressed. They
thought it premature. But it was a straw that showed which
way the revolutionary wind was blowing.</p>
<p>Captain Philip Dimitt, who was at the head of this movement,
was commandant at the fortress at Goliad with about
eighty men under his command.</p>
<p>Over at San Antonio at this time, there was much dissatisfaction
among the volunteers remaining there. They were
more restless than ever, with their own flag waving above the
Alamo and no enemy in sight. They had left their homes and
firesides for a purpose. It was fighting they were eager for,
not idling around a camp-fire.</p>
<p>They were, therefore, delighted when an expedition was set
on foot for the capture of Matamoras on the Rio Grande
River. General Houston, who had fixed his headquarters at
Washington on the Brazos, wished to place Colonel James
Bowie in command of this expedition; but in the confusion
arising from the quarrels between Governor Smith and his
council at San Felipe, an English physician, named Grant,
assumed the leadership (January, 1836).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Dr. Grant had taken part in the storming of San Antonio;
he was brave and gallant, and a favorite with his fellow-soldiers.
Two hundred volunteers gathered under his standard;
he helped himself without leave to arms and ammunition from
the fortress stores, took clothing and provisions from the
townspeople, and started for Matamoras.</p>
<p>He halted at Goliad. But only long enough to seize and
press into service Captain Dimitt&rsquo;s drove of army horses.</p>
<p>Here by order of the council, who had decided to sustain
Grant, he was joined by Colonel Frank W. Johnson, and they
marched away, leaving Captain
Dimitt indignant and angry.</p>
<p>The citizens and soldiers at San
Antonio were likewise indignant
and angry; and with far better
reason. Colonel Neill, left by
Johnson in command of the Alamo
with only sixty men, sent to General
Houston a report describing
the helpless and suffering condition
of that place after the high-handed
raid of Grant and his
volunteers.</p>
<p>Houston was much disturbed by
this report. He enclosed it to
Governor Smith, requesting him to
refer it to the council. The commander-in-chief denounced
the action of Grant in strong terms and added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within thirty hours I shall set out for the army, and repair
there with all possible dispatch. I pray that a confidential dispatch
may meet me at Goliad.... No language can express
my anguish of soul. Oh! save my poor country! Send supplies
to the sick and the hungry, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left Washington on the Brazos River on the 8th of
January and reached Goliad on the 16th. On his arrival he
sent for Colonel Bowie.</p>

<p class="caption">James Bowie.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>James Bowie had come to Texas with Long&rsquo;s expedition.
He was a famous Indian fighter. In 1831, near the near the old San
Saba Mission, with ten companions, including his brother,
Rezin Bowie, he had fought one hundred and sixty Comanches
and Caddoes, armed with bows and arrows, and guns. The
savages surprised and surrounded the little party, discharging
their arrows and firing their guns in true Indian fashion from
behind rocks, trees, and bushes. The fire was returned, and
at every crack of a rifle a redskin bit the dust. The crafty
warriors, finding they could not dislodge the hunters, set fire to
the dry prairie grass; then they renewed the attack, rending
the air with shrill yells. &ldquo;The sparks flew so thick,&rdquo; said
Rezin Bowie afterward, &ldquo;that we could not open our powder-horns
without danger of being blown up.&rdquo; But they held their
ground. The Indians drew off at nightfall, and all night long
the hunters heard them wailing their dead. The next morning
the red warriors had disappeared. Bowie lost but one man in
this fight; the Indians had eighty-two killed and wounded.</p>
<p>Bowie was as noted for his coolness and prudence as for his
unflinching courage. In person he was tall and fair, with soft
blue eyes, and a somewhat careless address. He had married
a Mexican lady&mdash;the daughter of Vice-Governor Veramendi of
San Antonio&mdash;and was devoted to the interests of Texas.
He was the inventor of the deadly knife which bears his name.</p>
<p>The result of the interview between Houston and Bowie was
that Bowie left Goliad the next morning for San Antonio, with
a company of thirty men. He bore orders from Houston to
Colonel Neill to leave San Antonio, blow up the fort, and bring
off the artillery.</p>
<p>Colonel Neill found it impossible to get teams to transport
the artillery; he therefore did not carry out any of these instructions.
Bowie remained at San Antonio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Houston made an effort to concentrate at Goliad and Refugio
the slender force which made up his army. But he was so hampered
by the intrigues and wrangling of the government officials,
that early in February he gave up the command and returned
to Washington on the Brazos, leaving Colonel James W.
Fannin in command of Goliad, with four hundred men.
On the 25th of the same month a messenger came into
Goliad. His face was worn with an anxiety which he did not
try to conceal; his eyes were heavy with fatigue. He sought
Fannin and had a brief but earnest talk with him. Then he
turned, setting his face in the direction whence he had come,
and went his way.</p>
<p>This messenger was the fearless and courtly South Carolinian,
James B. Bonham. His message was from Colonel Travis, pent
up in the fortress of the Alamo and besieged by the army of
Santa Anna. He appealed for help from Fannin and the army
at Goliad.</p>
<p>On the 28th Fannin started with reinforcements of men
and artillery to the relief of Travis; but before he was fairly
on the way his wagons broke down. While he was trying
to get them repaired, and at the same time uncertain as to
whether he should go on to San Antonio or not, Placido Benevidas
(B&#257;-n&#257;-vee&prime;das), one of Grant&rsquo;s men, came up with weighty
news. The Mexican General Urrea (Ur-r&#257;&prime;a) was marching
upon Goliad with an army of one thousand men. Fannin
returned in haste to the town and began to strengthen his
fortifications.</p>
<p>San Patricio, where Grant and Johnson were encamped, was
surprised on the night of the 28th of February by Urrea&rsquo;s
soldiers. The volunteers, with the exception of Johnson himself
and four of his companions who managed to escape, were
all captured or killed. Grant, who was out with a squad of
men collecting horses, was killed some days later and his body
frightfully mutilated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h3 id="c24">2. IN CHURCH AND FORTRESS.</h3>
<p>A line of blood and flame seemed indeed to be closing upon
Texas. General Urrea, after destroying Grant and his volunteers,
was advancing toward Goliad with one thousand men.
Santa Anna, with an army of seven thousand, had invested
San Antonio.</p>
<p>The defeat of General Cos had filled the haughty dictator of
Mexico with fury. It was past belief that a handful of the
despised colonists, armed with hunting-rifles, should have put to
rout his own well-equipped regulars. He determined to punish
this insolence as it deserved. And not only to punish, but to
set an iron heel upon the rebellious province.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic22">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="384" />
<p class="caption">THE ALAMO, SAN ANTONIO</p>
</div>
<p>All prisoners were to be shot; all who had taken part in the
revolution were to be driven out of the country; the best lands
were to be divided among the Mexican soldiers. The expenses
of the rebellion were to be paid by the Texans. All foreigners
giving aid to the rebels were to be treated as pirates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>By the 1st of February Santa Anna had sent General Urrea
to Matamoras, a town near the mouth of the Rio Grande
River, with orders to proceed from that place against Refugio
and Goliad. He himself took command of the main army,
with General Filisola (Fee-lee-so&prime;la) as second in command.
General Cos and his men, who had taken oath not to bear
arms again during the war, joined the army at the crossing
of the Rio Grande River. On the 23d of February the first
division of this united force appeared on the heights of the
Alazan, west of San Antonio.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the garrison were scattered about the town.
No warning of a near approach of the enemy had come, and
things looked tranquil enough that morning, with the soft winter
sunshine flooding the yellow adobe walls and glinting the
limpid river.</p>
<p>A cry from the sentinel posted on the roof of San Fernando
Church startled the stillness; its echoes leaped from street to
street; the alarum bells burst into a clanging peal. The Mexicans
were already pouring down the slopes west of the San
Pedro River.</p>
<p>The garrison hastily crossed the San Antonio River and
entered the fortress of the Alamo. One of the officers, Lieutenant
Dickinson, galloped in on horseback, with his baby on
his arm and his wife behind him. Some beef-cattle grazing
around the fort were driven in and the gates were closed.</p>
<p>Colonel William B. Travis had succeeded Neill in the command
of the fort, which was garrisoned by one hundred and
forty-five men. Travis was but twenty-eight years of age; confident,
bold, determined, and full of patriotic ardor. Colonel
James Bowie was second in command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Among other defenders of the Alamo were Colonel James B.
Bonham of South Carolina and David Crockett of Tennessee&mdash;&ldquo;Davy&rdquo;
Crockett, the backwoodsman, bear-hunter, wit, and
politician. Crockett had reached San Antonio just before the
siege, with a small company of Tennesseeans, and offered his
services to Travis. He was a picturesque figure in his fringed
and belted buck-skin blouse and coon-skin cap. His long rifle,
Betsy, had &ldquo;spoken&rdquo; in the war of 1812, and echoed since on
many an Indian trail. Its last word was to be spoken at the
defense of the Alamo.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic23">
<img src="images/p23.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="600" />
<p class="caption">David Crockett.</p>
</div>
<p>The Mission of the Alamo, established in 1703 and several
times removed, was finally built, in 1744, on the spot where it
now stands. Like the other missions, it was both a church
and a fortress. It is on the
east side of the San Antonio
River, facing the town to
westward. The cross-shaped
church, slit with narrow windows
and partly roofless,
stood on the southeast corner
of a walled plaza several
acres in extent. The other
buildings&mdash;convent, hospital,
barracks, and prison&mdash;were
within the enclosure.
There was also a small
convent-yard adjoining the
chapel. All of the buildings
were of stone; the enclosing
walls were built of adobe bricks. The sacristy of the church
was used as a powder magazine. The place was defended by
fourteen pieces of artillery.</p>
<p>Santa Anna arrived in person on the 23d. He took possession
of San Antonio town and sent a summons to the rebels
in the Alamo for unconditional surrender. Travis received
and dismissed the messengers with courtesy; then answered
by the mouth of a cannon, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; At the defiant boom which
stirred the peaceful air of the valley, a blood-red flag was
placed upon the tower of San Fernando, proclaiming &ldquo;no
quarter&rdquo;; and a thunder of guns opened the attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The besiegers at first made little headway. If they ventured
across the river they were within reach of those unerring rifles
they had such cause to dread. It was the third day before
they succeeded in planting a battery between the fort and the
bridge.</p>
<p>The besieged within the fortress were calm and confident,
though they were kept day and night at rifle and cannon. But
they were fighting at fearful odds. Travis sent out an impassioned
appeal to the council for aid. He also dispatched
Colonel Bonham to Goliad, asking for Fannin&rsquo;s assistance.
At the same time he proudly wrote: &ldquo;I shall never surrender
or retreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the eighth day of the siege thirty-two volunteers from
Gonzales succeeded in passing the Mexican lines and entered
the fort. Two days later Colonel Bonham slipped in alone,
but bringing news that Fannin would march at once with men
and artillery. On the 1st of March Travis wrote to the council;
it was his last letter. &ldquo;I shall continue to hold this
place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;until I get relief from my countrymen, or I
shall perish in the attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But steady as was his spirit, he could not shut his eyes to
the fact that the desperate game was well-nigh played out.
On the 4th of March he called his men together and made
them a short but ringing speech. There was, he told them, no
longer any hope of reinforcements; death was staring them all
in the face, and nothing remained but to sell their lives as
dearly as possible. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he concluded, drawing a line on
the ground with his sword, &ldquo;whoever is willing to die like a
hero, let him cross this line.&rdquo; There was not a moment of
hesitation. Gravely and silently, one by one, the men, with
one exception,<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> stepped across the line and ranged themselves
beside their leader. Bowie, who was sick, had himself lifted
over in his cot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Sunday morning, March 6, between midnight and dawn, the
final assault was made by the besiegers. The Mexican bugles
sounded the notes of <i>Duquelo</i> (no quarter); the thunder of
cannon followed. The devoted little band of Texans, weary
and worn with constant watching and incessant fighting, sprang
to arms as cheerfully and quickly as to a holiday parade.</p>
<p>The Mexicans, two thousand five hundred strong, closed
about the walls. They were provided with scaling ladders,
axes, and crowbars. A cordon of cavalry was placed around
the fort to prevent escape.</p>
<p>The enemy advanced in the gray dawnlight, under a deadly
fire from the fort. Twice they placed their ladders against the
walls, and twice they recoiled before the terrible hail of shot
and shell poured upon them from the fort. The third time,
driven by their officers at the point of the sword, the soldiers
climbed the walls and swarmed over into the enclosure. Then
began a stubborn and bloody combat, which strewed the plaza
with corpses. The Texans fought grimly, silently, furiously,
with pistols, with knives, with the butts of their rifles, dropping
one by one, but sending as they fell scores of Mexicans to a
bloody death.</p>
<p>It was in the old church, dedicated to peace and prayer, that
the last conflict took place. Here Crockett was killed, with
Betsy, his long rifle, whose voice had resounded clearly above
the uproar, in his hand. Bowie was slaughtered in his cot,
after killing several of his assailants. Major T. C. Evans was
shot in the act of putting fire to the powder magazine, as he
had promised to do in case things came to the worst.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dickinson and her child, with two Mexican women,
were in a small arched room to the right of the chapel door.
They were saved by the kindness of the Mexican officer,
Colonel Almonte.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The tall form of Travis had towered for an instant only
above the battle-waves near a breach in the north wall; then
he had gone down, his brave heart stilled forever. With his
last breath he cried in a voice which rang above the deadly
tumult: &ldquo;<i>No rendirse muchachos!</i>&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t surrender, boys!)</p>
<p>Bonham fell near him and almost at the same moment.</p>
<p>Before nine o&rsquo;clock the butchery was complete. Two thousand
five hundred Mexicans, cavalry, artillery, and infantry,
fresh and unwearied, had conquered after eleven days&rsquo; siege a
handful of poorly armed, outworn &ldquo;rebels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Anna directed the assault from a battery near the
river. After the carnage was ended he came into the fort. He
surveyed the bloody scene with a smile of satisfaction. His
victory had cost him a thousand or more of dead and many
wounded; but what did that matter? Not a Texan was left to
tell the tale of the Alamo!</p>
<p>The next day the dead bodies of the Texans were collected
in heaps and burned. The smoke of that fire ascended to high
heaven like a prayer for vengeance. The answer when it came
was terrible.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dickinson and her child, two Mexican women, and a
negro servant belonging to Travis were the only survivors of
this massacre. Mrs. Dickinson was placed on a horse with her
child in her arms and sent by Santa Anna to the colonists with
an insolent message announcing the fall of the Alamo.</p>
<h3 id="c25">3. FORT DEFIANCE.</h3>
<p>On the 1st of March the General Convention met at Washington
on the Brazos. On the 2d, while Travis&rsquo; signal guns
were still sending their sturdy boom across the prairies, a
declaration of independence was read and adopted.</p>
<p>Houston was made commander-in-chief of the armies of the
Republic of Texas. David G. Burnet was elected President
and Lorenzo D. Zavala Vice-President. Thomas J. Rusk was
made Secretary of War.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Sunday, the 6th of March, the day the Alamo fell, Travis&rsquo;
last appeal reached Washington&mdash;after the hand that wrote it
was cold in death. His letter was read by the President to the
members of the convention; it produced a powerful effect.
In the first burst of feeling it was even proposed that the
convention should adjourn, arm, and march to San Antonio.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic24">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="402" />
<p class="caption">Mission at Goliad.</p>
</div>
<p>Houston spoke earnestly against such a step, and as soon as
quiet was restored, he himself with two or three companions
left for Gonzales, where the new volunteers were ordered to
gather.</p>
<p>The air as he rode westward was thick with rumors. He
arrived at Gonzales on the 11th. The same day came the first
tidings of the fall of the Alamo. It filled the town with a wail
of desolation. Of the thirty-two men who had marched from
Gonzales to the relief of Travis, and to their own death,
twenty had left wives and children behind them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The arrival of Mrs. Dickinson with her child, and her story
of the siege with all its ghastly details, added to the gloom. The
moans of the widow and the fatherless mingled with the dreary
bustle of preparation for flight. For it was rumored that the
bloodthirsty Mexicans were approaching.</p>
<p>General Houston had found three hundred recruits at
Gonzales. But they were unprepared for an attack; they had
neither provisions nor munitions of war; the place was without
defenses of any kind. He therefore gave orders for retreat.
At nightfall on the 13th the forlorn handful of women and
children mounted horses, or clambered into wagons where a
few household goods had been hastily piled; the troops formed
around them, and at midnight the march began.</p>
<p>As they moved away across the prairie a light reddened the
sky behind them. It came from the flames of their own burning
houses. A cry burst from the women, and the eyes already
swollen with weeping overflowed again at the sight of their
desolated hearthstones.</p>
<p class="tb">When Colonel Fannin found himself unable to march to the
relief of the Alamo, he re&euml;ntered Goliad. He now knew that
Urrea was advancing rapidly, and he made haste to strengthen
his position. He had at this time five hundred men under his
command. They occupied the Mission of Espiritu Santo,
called by Fannin Fort Defiance. Earthworks had been thrown
up around the old church, ditches dug, and cannon mounted.
But the defenses were weak, the men were poorly fed and
scantily clad. They were often compelled to mount guard barefoot.
Fannin was filled with gloomy forebodings, although the
signal-guns of the Alamo, which were to be fired as long as
the flag continued to wave over that fortress, were not yet
silenced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>About the 12th of March Captain King was sent by Fannin
with a small detachment of men to bring away the women and
children from Refugio, a small town about twenty miles distant.
King was attacked by the advance guard of Urrea&rsquo;s army, and
had barely time to throw himself into the mission church at
Refugio. From there he sent to Fannin for more troops.
Colonel Ward, with one hundred and twenty-five men, immediately
joined him in the church where he was entrenched.</p>
<p>The next morning (14th) Captain King with his men left
the fort on a scouting expedition. About three miles from the
mission they were surprised by a large body of Mexicans, to
whom they surrendered. A few hours later they were stripped
of their clothing by their captors and shot. Their unburied
bodies were left to decay on the open prairie.</p>
<p>The same morning, about ten o&rsquo;clock, fifteen of Ward&rsquo;s men
were sent from the mission to the river about a hundred yards
away to get water. They had filled two barrels and placed
them on a cart drawn by a couple of oxen, and were about
returning to the fort when some bullets sang over their heads.
A glance showed them the Mexican army on the other side of
the river, not half a mile distant. They hurried on as fast as
they could, and reached the mission in safety with a good part
of the water. One barrel was emptied of about half of its
contents through a hole made by a shot from the advancing
enemy.</p>
<p>Urrea attacked the barricaded church. The battle lasted
nearly all day, but late in the afternoon he drew off his beaten
and discouraged force; he had two hundred killed and wounded.
Ward&rsquo;s loss was three wounded.</p>
<p>But the ammunition of the besieged was nearly exhausted,
and that night, after supplying the three wounded men with
water, Colonel Ward and his men stole quietly out of the church
and slipped unseen past the Mexican sentinels.</p>
<p>On the 21st, after weary marches through swamp and thicket
and constant skirmishes with the enemy, they surrendered on
honorable terms to Urrea, and were taken back to Goliad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h3 id="c26">4. PALM SUNDAY.</h3>
<p>Fannin turned away from General Houston&rsquo;s messenger on
the morning of the 13th (March) with an anxious and gloomy
face. The messenger, Captain Desauque, had just come in
from Gonzales, leaving woe and despair behind him. He
brought the black tidings of the fall of the Alamo, and he bore
orders from the commander-in-chief for Fannin to blow up the
fort, bury or throw into the river such of the cannon as he could
not bring away, and retreat to Victoria on the Guadalupe
River.</p>
<p>There was scant time in which to mourn the fall of the
Alamo, but the dark looks on the men&rsquo;s faces, as they buried
the guns and demolished the fortifications, told of what they
were thinking.</p>
<p>Fannin sent a courier to Ward and King, ordering them to
return at once from Refugio; this courier, as well as others
sent later, was captured by Mexican scouts.</p>
<p>Fannin waited five days in great suspense, loth to abandon
these officers and the women and children whom they had been
sent to protect.</p>
<p>At length came the news of Ward&rsquo;s retreat from Refugio.
The remaining works of Fort Defiance were destroyed, the
buildings were set on fire, artillery and ammunition were loaded
on wagons; the drums called the men from their ruined quarters.
Mrs. Cash, the only woman left in Goliad, was placed in
their midst, and, with a last glance at Fort Defiance, Fannin
began his fatal retreat.</p>
<p>This was on the 19th of March.</p>
<p>The wagons, enveloped in fog, creaked their way across the
San Antonio River and over the prairie beyond. The troops
marched steadily. An ominous silence reigned everywhere;
not even a Mexican scout was to be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Several miles from Goliad Fannin halted an hour in the open
prairie to allow his jaded and hungry ox-teams to graze. At
the moment the march was taken up, a line of Mexican cavalry
came out of the wood skirting the Colita (Co-lee&prime;ta) Creek two
miles away. Their arms glistened in the sunlight, for the fog
had lifted. A compact mass of infantry followed. Urrea&rsquo;s
entire army was upon them.</p>
<p>Fannin immediately formed his men in a hollow square with
the wagons and teams in the center. His position had the
double disadvantage of being unprotected and in a miry hollow
some feet below the surface of the prairie around. But his
men received the Mexican advance with a volley from the
artillery and a galling fire from their rifles.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>The cannon, for want of water to sponge them, soon became
useless. With small arms alone, charge after charge of the enemy
was repulsed; the prairie was soon covered with dead and
dying men and horses.</p>
<p>Early in the action Fannin received a severe wound in his
thigh, but in spite of this he continued to direct his men with
great courage and coolness.</p>
<p>Many a poor fellow loaded and fired his gun with his own
life-blood wetting the sod about him. One lad, named Hal
Ripley, fifteen years of age, after his thigh was broken by a
ball, climbed, with Mrs. Cash&rsquo;s help, into her cart. There,
with his back propped and a rest for his rifle, he fired away
calmly until another bullet shattered his right arm. He had,
in the meantime, killed four Mexicans. &ldquo;Now, Mother Cash,&rdquo;
he said cheerfully, &ldquo;you may take me down.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>At dark the Mexicans ceased firing and made their camp in
the timber. Their bugles sounded shrilly the livelong night.
That night was one of agony in the bloody little camp on the
prairie. There were but seven Texans killed, but more than
sixty were badly wounded. These groaned in the darkness,
begging for water which could not be had, imploring aid which
mortal hand was powerless to give. Those who were not
wounded lay breathless and exhausted on the trampled ground,
staring up at the sky and wondering what the morrow would
bring forth.</p>
<p>The morrow brought no help to them. To the already large
force of Urrea it brought reinforcements to the number of three
or four hundred men with artillery, ammunition, and supplies.</p>
<p>Fannin watched the enemy ranging his men under the morning
sky and dragging his cannon into place; then his haggard
eyes sought his own brave little band. They were without
food, drink, or ammunition; their teams were killed or disabled;
their cannon were useless; the cries of their wounded
rose mournfully on the heavy air. He called his officers
together and submitted the question: &ldquo;Shall we surrender or
not?&rdquo; The private soldiers were then asked to decide for
themselves.</p>
<p>During this consultation Mrs. Cash went to the Mexican
camp to beg for water for the wounded men. She was accompanied
by her son, a boy of fourteen years, who, like Hal
Ripley, had fought the day before with the best and the bravest.
They passed over the prairie strewn with the dead and
dying, and entered the presence of the Mexican general. &ldquo;I
have come, sir,&rdquo; she said, fearlessly, &ldquo;to ask you before the
fighting begins again, to give me water for our wounded.&rdquo;
Urrea looked at her without replying, and then his eyes fell
upon the shot-pouch and powder-horn of the boy. &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo;
he demanded sternly, &ldquo;are you not ashamed to bring a child
like that into such scenes?&rdquo; The boy himself answered with
his blue eyes kindling: &ldquo;Young as I am, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know
my rights, as everybody in Texas does, and I mean to have
them or die.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>What the general might have said in answer to this insolent
speech cannot be known, for at that moment a white flag was
raised in the Texan camp.</p>
<p>The majority of Fannin&rsquo;s men were in favor of surrender,
though many thought in their hearts it would be better to die
with arms in their hands like the defenders of the Alamo.
Fannin himself was opposed to surrender. &ldquo;We beat them
off yesterday,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and we can do it again
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Favorable terms were secured from General Urrea by Fannin,
and the prisoners of war were marched back to Goliad and
placed in the mission church&mdash;Fannin&rsquo;s Fort Defiance. The
wounded were brought in the next day and housed in the barracks;
and several days later Ward and his men were thrust
into the overcrowded church.</p>
<p>The prisoners were ill fed and badly treated. But when the
first shock of their defeat had passed, they began to look forward
eagerly to their release. They were told that they were
to be placed at once on ships and sent to New Orleans, where
they would be paroled and set at liberty.</p>
<p>On the Saturday evening after their capture, the sounds of
gay laughter echoed from the time-stained walls of the chapel.
The men sang &ldquo;Home, Sweet Home,&rdquo; to the music of a flute
played by one of their number. Fannin talked of his wife and
children far into the night.</p>
<p>The next day was Palm Sunday.</p>
<p>In the old days of the mission, the Indian converts were
accustomed on Palm Sunday to walk up the aisles of the
church bearing green branches in their hands, in memory of
Christ&rsquo;s entry into Jerusalem; and hymns of joy and praise
mingled with the incense which arose from the altar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>At just the sunrise hour, when in those old times the converts
came carrying their dewy sweet-smelling boughs from the
forest, the prisoners were awakened by their guards and
marched out of the church. They were formed into four divisions
and hurried away under various pretences. Some were
even told that they were starting home.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of a mile from the fort they were halted,
drawn up in sections, and ordered to kneel. Everything had
been so orderly, so natural, so swift, that only at the last
moment did the men realize what was about to happen. &ldquo;My
God, boys,&rdquo; cried a voice that echoed like a shot on the clear
air, &ldquo;they are going to kill us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guns of the guards were already turned upon the prisoners.
A deliberate discharge followed this despairing cry;
another, and another, and a heap of writhing, bleeding bodies
was all that remained of Fannin&rsquo;s gallant band. A few
escaped, struggling to their feet and fleeing to the swamp pursued
by shots and curses. The surgeons and one or two
others were saved by the kindness of Colonel Garay, a Mexican
officer.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> One of these, Dr. Shackelford, captain of the
Red Rovers, heard the firing as he entered the tent of his
preserver. He did not know that anything had gone wrong;
but he trembled and turned pale, and well he might! For
three of his young nephews and his own son were among the
killed.</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;ora Alvarez, a Mexican woman, concealed several prisoners
until after the massacre, and afterward helped them to
escape. It was her tears and entreaties which moved Colonel
Garay to risk keeping the surgeons in his tent. While the
butchery was going on, she stood in the plaza, with her black
hair streaming over her shoulders; and with flashing eyes she
denounced Santa Anna and called down the vengeance of
heaven upon his head. When she learned that Dr. Shackelford&rsquo;s
son had been shot, she burst into tears and cried out,
&ldquo;Oh, if I had only known, I would have saved him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Her husband was one of Urrea&rsquo;s officers, and her kindness
to the Texan prisoners throughout the war ought never to be
forgotten. &ldquo;Her name,&rdquo; writes one of the survivors of the
massacre, &ldquo;should be written in letters of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two brave boys, Harry Ripley and young Cash, were
also among the slain.</p>
<p>The wounded men were then dragged out of their beds and
shot. Fannin, who was the last to die, met his fate inside the
fort, it is even said inside the consecrated church. His high
courage sustained him to the end. After receiving the promise
of the officer in charge that he should not be shot in the head,
that his body should be decently buried, and that his watch
should be sent to his wife, he fastened the bandage about his
eyes with his own hands, and welcomed death like a soldier.
Not one of the promises made to him was kept.</p>
<p>The dead Texans to the number of three hundred and fifty
were stripped of their clothing and piled, naked, in heaps on
the ground. A little brushwood was thrown over them and
set on fire. It burned, crackling a few moments, and then the
flames died out. The half-consumed flesh was torn from the
bones by vultures.</p>
<p>This cold-blooded murder was done by order of Santa Anna.
For it, as for the massacre at the Alamo, a deadly vengeance
was at hand.</p>
<h3 id="c27">5. REMEMBER THE ALAMO! REMEMBER GOLIAD!</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 21st of April, 1836, Houston, with his
army of seven hundred Texans, and Santa Anna, with his
army of more than twice that number of Mexicans, were
encamped within a mile of each other near the banks of
Buffalo Bayou.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The country was in a wild panic. Men, women, and children
were fleeing before the very rumor of Santa Anna&rsquo;s approach,
as in the pioneer days they had not fled before the tomahawks
of the Comanches.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s slow retreat<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> (begun on March 13), from Gonzales
to the Colorado, from the Colorado to various points on
the Brazos, with the enemy close upon his rear, had filled the
stoutest hearts with doubt and alarm. After more than two
months of suspense charged with the terrible episodes of San
Patricio, Refugio, the Alamo, and Goliad, and the burning of
San Felipe, Gonzales, and Harrisburg, the people began to ask
of each other what would be the end.</p>
<p>Here at last, on an open field and in a fair fight, the question
was about to be answered.</p>
<p>Santa Anna, after the fall of the Alamo, was filled with vain
glory. He called himself the Napoleon of the West, and
looked upon the Texan &ldquo;rebels&rdquo; as already conquered and
suppliant at his feet. From his headquarters at San Antonio
he directed his army to possess the country and to shoot every
man taken with a gun in his hand. One division, under General
Gaona, was ordered to Nacogdoches; General Urrea, after the
battle of Colita, was ordered to sweep the coast from Victoria to
Anahuac with his division; the central division, under Generals
Sesma and Filisola, followed Houston almost step by step in
his retreat. Santa Anna himself accompanied this division.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>On the 15th of April, believing that Houston was at last in
his power, the Mexican commander-in-chief left his main army
on the Brazos and marched, with about one thousand men, to
Harrisburg, where he hoped to capture President Burnet and
the members of his
cabinet. He found
Harrisburg deserted;
whereupon he set fire
to the town, and
hurried to New Washington.
From there,
after burning the
straggling village, he
intended to move on
to Lynch&rsquo;s Ferry
(now Lynchburg) at
the junction of Buffalo
Bayou and the
San Jacinto River.
His plan was to pursue
the government
officials to Galveston,
whither they had retreated,
make them
prisoners, and so end
the war. While his
troops were in line
for the ferry (April 20) he was startled by the arrival of a
scout who reported the approach of Houston with his entire
command. Santa Anna, thus cut off from his army, was taken
completely by surprise.</p>
<p>This was the moment Houston had so long awaited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need not talk,&rdquo; he said to Rusk, the Secretary of War,
who was with the army. &ldquo;You think we ought to fight, and I
think so, too.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The rising sun of April 21 looked down bright and glowing
upon the two hostile camps. The Texans were in a grove
of moss-hung live oaks; in front of them a rolling prairie, gay
with spring flowers, stretched away to the marshy bottom lands
of the San Jacinto River; behind them Buffalo Bayou rolled its
dark waters to Galveston Bay. The &ldquo;Twin Sisters,&rdquo; two small
cannon presented to the Republic by the citizens of Cincinnati,
were planted on the rising ground before the camp.
They were flanked on either side by the infantry. The cavalry,
under the command of Mirabeau B. Lamar, was placed in the
rear.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic26">
<img src="images/p25a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="231" />
<p class="caption">Battlefield of San Jacinto.</p>
</div>
<p>Santa Anna&rsquo;s camp also faced the prairie, but it had directly
in the rear the oozy, grass-grown San Jacinto marsh.</p>
<p>The day before (20th) when the ground was first occupied
by the two armies, there had been some skirmishing. But
this morning passed in a quiet, which was broken only by the
arrival of General Cos at the enemy&rsquo;s camp with a reinforcement
of five hundred men.</p>
<p>Toward noon a profound silence fell upon the Mexican camp.
The men, officers and soldiers, from Santa Anna to the humblest
private, were taking their <i>siesta</i> (afternoon nap).</p>
<p>Meantime, General Houston, after a short consultation with
his officers, sent for Deaf Smith.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Deaf Smith was a bold, cool-headed, shrewd guide and spy,
who had come from New York to Texas in 1821. He was
hard of hearing (hence his nickname), silent and secretive in
his manner, with the instinct and the unerring sight of a savage.
It was Deaf Smith who had guided Fannin and Bowie from La
Espada to Mission Concepcion, and led Johnson and Milam
through the dark streets at the storming of San Antonio. It
was he who had been sent to meet Mrs. Dickinson on her
dreary journey from the Alamo; and when General Houston
retreated from Gonzales, Deaf Smith, with one or two companions,
was left to spy upon the movements of the enemy.</p>
<p>Houston dispatched Smith with secret orders to cut down
and burn Vince&rsquo;s bridge, about eight miles distant.</p>
<p>This bridge, which both armies had crossed on their march
to their present position, spanned Vince&rsquo;s Bayou, a narrow
but deep stream running into Buffalo Bayou. To destroy it
was to destroy the only means of retreat for either army.</p>
<p>General Houston, after making these arrangements, paraded
his army. The men were in high spirits. Their eyes were
dancing, their fingers itched to pull the triggers of their guns.
The day was waning; it was nearly three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.
At this moment Deaf Smith galloped in, his horse white
with foam, with the news that Vince&rsquo;s bridge had been burned.</p>
<p>The order to advance was given. A single fife struck up
the curiously inappropriate tune, &ldquo;Will you come to the bower
I have shaded for you.&rdquo; The cannon were rushed forward
within two hundred yards of the Mexican camp, and fire
belched from the mouth of the &ldquo;twins.&rdquo; The left wing of
infantry under Colonel Sidney Sherman began the attack.
There was a cry which split the air: &ldquo;Remember the Alamo!
Remember Goliad!&rdquo; and the whole force hurled itself forward
like an avalanche.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The effect was appalling. The Mexicans half awake, dazed
and bewildered by the sudden charge, hardly tried after their
first feeble volley, to return the fire of their assailants.
Within a few moments the Texans, still uttering their hoarse
watchword of vengeance, had leaped the barricade, and were
in the very heart of Santa Anna&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<p>Too excited or too thirsty for revenge to load, they beat
down the foe with the butts of their rifles, clubbed them with
pistols, slashed them with keen-edged bowie knives. The
Mexicans fled like frightened sheep, some into the muddy
morass where they were
caught as in a trap, others
toward the bayou and the
ruined bridge, others again
to the cover of the timber
where they made haste to
surrender. &ldquo;Me no Alamo!
Me no Alamo!&rdquo; cried many
of the panic-stricken soldiers,
falling on their knees before
their captors.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic27">
<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="584" />
<p class="caption">Sidney Sherman.</p>
</div>
<p>By twilight the fleeing
Mexicans were nearly all
captured or killed, and the
victors had time to breathe
and to count their own dead.
They had seven dead and twenty-seven wounded. Among the
latter was General Houston, who received a wound in the ankle,
which caused him to limp during the remainder of his life.</p>
<p>The Mexicans lost six hundred and thirty-two killed and
two hundred and eight wounded. Seven hundred and thirty-two
prisoners were taken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Among the prisoners were the oath-breaker, General Cos;<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a>
Almonte, Santa Anna&rsquo;s private secretary; and Colonel Portillia,
the officer who had been in command at Goliad when
Fannin and his men were shot. General Santa Anna, riding
a handsome black horse, had escaped. He was pursued as he
fled from the field by Henry Karnes, who knew from the
flying horseman&rsquo;s glittering uniform that he must be an
officer of rank; he did not dream, however, that he was following
Santa Anna. He felt sure of capturing the officer at
Vince&rsquo;s Bayou, for he rode straight for the destroyed bridge.
But after a single second of hesitation on the bank, the horse
and rider seemed to rise in the air and then plunge downward.
When Captain Karnes reached the stream, the gallant animal
was floundering in the mud on the opposite side, unable to
clamber up the steep bank. The rider had disappeared.</p>
<h3 id="c28">6. TWO GENERALS.</h3>
<p>The next morning (22nd) General Houston was lying under
an oak somewhat apart from the camp. The pain of his
wound had kept him awake during the night, and he was sleeping
lightly. Suddenly an excited murmur ran through the
camp, a clamor of Mexican voices arose: &ldquo;El Presidente!
El Presidente!&rdquo; and some soldiers approached, having in their
midst a man dressed in soiled linen trousers, a blue jacket, a
soldier&rsquo;s cap, and red worsted slippers. His linen, however,
was of the finest, and he wore jeweled studs in his shirt
front.</p>
<p>Houston, awakened by the noise, looked up. His visitor
bowed. &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he said in Spanish, &ldquo;General Antonio Lopez
de Santa Anna, and a prisoner of war, at your service.&rdquo; He
had just been captured, hiding, miserable and forlorn, in the
long grass on the further side of the bayou. Houston waved
his hand to a tool-chest near by, and Santa Anna sat down.</p>
<p>A greater physical contrast can hardly be imagined than
that between these two men now gazing steadily and silently
at each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>The Dictator of Mexico was small and thin and not above
five feet five inches in height. His swarthy face was ill-favored
almost to repulsiveness; his small black eyes were
cold and cruel. Houston was tall and finely proportioned,
with fair complexion, open forehead, and fine blue eyes. Perhaps
the one point of resemblance between the two generals
lay in a certain foppishness in dress. But on this occasion
this appeared in neither. Santa Anna had exchanged his
gaudy uniform for the disguise he wore, and Houston was
ill-kempt and shabby in his old campaign uniform.</p>
<p>Almonte, who had been sent for to act as interpreter, now
came up and the interview began. Santa Anna was at first
very humble; he even wept copiously. But after swallowing
some opium he recovered his arrogance, and demanded to be
treated as a prisoner of war. He wished to arrange for his
immediate release.</p>
<p>When Houston dryly asked what consideration he could
expect after the bloody scenes at the Alamo and Goliad, he
pleaded the usage of war for the carnage at the Alamo. As
for Goliad, he declared that Urrea had deceived him with
regard to Fannin&rsquo;s surrender, and pretended to denounce his
subordinate officer in bitter terms. &ldquo;Urrea told me Fannin
was vanquished,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I was ordered by my government
to shoot every man found with a weapon in his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are yourself the government,&rdquo; Houston replied curtly.
&ldquo;A Dictator has no superior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the order of Congress,&rdquo; Santa Anna insisted, &ldquo;and
that compels me to treat as pirates all who are found under
arms. Urrea had no authority to make an agreement with
Fannin. He has deceived me, and when I am free he shall
suffer for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston listened to this bluster, but declined to make terms
with his prisoner, that power belonging alone to the Texan
Congress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>He treated the unfortunate general with generous courtesy,
returning to him his tents and personal effects, and permitting
him to be waited upon by his own servants.</p>
<p>An order signed by Santa Anna was carried by Deaf Smith
and Henry Karnes to General Filisola, the second in command,
who was encamped near San Felipe, to conduct the Mexican
troops to the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>The Texan soldiers could not understand the mercy shown
to the Mexican prisoners, particularly to Santa Anna, the cruel
and heartless foe who had tortured and put to death so many of
their brave countrymen. With dark and angry looks and open
threats they swarmed about the place of the interview. Some
of the officers were in favor of a drumhead court-martial and an
immediate execution. But better counsels prevailed, and Santa
Anna was allowed to retire to his camp-bed and rest in peace.</p>
<p>The night which followed the victory was one of wild and
grotesque rejoicing in the Texan camp. Huge bonfires were
lighted, and by the red glow of their flames, the soldiers danced
and sang and told over and over again the story of the great
day and its triumphs. The Mexican camp was overhauled;
the victors decked themselves with the arms of their foes,
buckling about their waists two, three, or four brace of pistols,
with powder-horns, shot-pouches, sabers, and bowie knives.
They rigged out the captured mules with the gold epaulets of the
Mexican officers, and the green and red cap-cords of the grenadiers.
Then, lighting hundreds of wax candles found among
the spoils, they paraded gayly about, waking the echoes of the
night with their shouts of laughter. All this was not in very
good taste, and it naturally made the prisoners very angry.
But they might well have reflected that at least it was a better
way of rejoicing over a victory than shooting prisoners in cold
blood and setting fire to their naked corpses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>The military stores taken in the battle, the cannon, small
arms, ammunition, and mules, were kept by the government.
The camp baggage was sold at auction, and the proceeds, with
the contents of the military money-chest, were divided among
the soldiers. This money, which amounted to about seven
dollars and a half to each man, was all that they received for
their service during the whole war.</p>
<p>General Santa Anna&rsquo;s handsome silver-mounted saddle was
purchased and presented to General Houston. The jeweled
dagger handed to his captors by the Mexican General was also
given to Houston.</p>
<h3 id="c29">7. HOW THE GOOD NEWS WAS BROUGHT.</h3>
<p>On the approach of Santa Anna&rsquo;s army, President Burnet
and his cabinet retired from Harrisburg to Galveston Island.
They were closely pressed by the advance of the Mexican cavalry
under Almonte. As the President stepped upon the flatboat
which was to take him to the schooner <i>Flash</i>, at the mouth
of the San Jacinto, he was for several moments a target for
Mexican guns. But he reached the <i>Flash</i> in safety, and the
boat sailed across the bay to the almost deserted island.
There, while the government officials waited in great anxiety
and suspense for news from the army, they were joined by a
large number of fugitives who had fled from their homes in the
general panic. The steamboat <i>Yellowstone</i>&mdash;which had conveyed
Houston&rsquo;s army across the Brazos at Groce&rsquo;s Ferry&mdash;came
down loaded with refugees from the Brazos and Colorado.
At Fort Bend it had passed the Mexican army under a hot fire.
The smokestacks were riddled with bullet holes. The Mexican
cavalrymen had tried at several points to lasso the boat
from the bank as it steamed by, but fortunately their ropes
were too short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The <i>Yellowstone</i> brought news that Houston&rsquo;s army was on
the road to Harrisburg. Burnet knew, therefore, that the long-delayed
fight would take place soon or never. Very few people
had any faith left in Houston&rsquo;s ability to defeat the Mexican
army. Santa Anna was looked for in Galveston at any moment.
Nearly all the women and children had already been placed on
board the <i>Flash</i>, and the captain of the boat had orders to sail
for New Orleans, where they would be safe.</p>
<p>General Houston&rsquo;s first duty, after settling affairs in his
somewhat disordered camp, was to send an express to the
President with news of the victory, and to request him to come
and treat in person with Santa Anna.</p>
<p>At the battle of Concepcion Captain Robert Calder, then a
private posted in the mission tower, had given notice of the
enemy&rsquo;s approach. This young officer, who had also fought
most gallantly in the battle
of San Jacinto, volunteered
to bear the General&rsquo;s dispatches
to President Burnet.
It is not to the young captain&rsquo;s
discredit that the presence
on the island of the
beautiful girl whom he afterward
married had something
to do with his eagerness to
perform this service.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic28">
<img src="images/p27.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="577" />
<p class="caption">Thomas J. Rusk.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>He started on the morning
of the 23d accompanied by B.
C. Franklin and two soldiers
detailed for the expedition.
No boat was to be had except an open and weather-stained
skiff with two pairs of oars. No provisions could be procured;
the country around had been swept clean by the Mexicans.
But the little party paddled away cheerily down the bayou.
Late at night they found some food in a deserted cabin on the
bank. The next day they entered the bay. The waves were
rough; it was hard rowing and the boat leaked badly. Captain
Calder had most of the work to do, the others having
given out completely. Much of the way they coasted close to
the shore, Calder wading and shoving or pulling the skiff along.
They saw but one living human being on their trip. This was
a wild African negro who had perhaps escaped from some slave-ship
on the coast. On the fifth day they crossed from Virginia
Point to the war-schooner <i>Invincible</i>, which was lying in the bay
off Galveston. As they approached, Captain Brown hailed
them through his speaking trumpet: &ldquo;What news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unexpected reply, &ldquo;Houston has defeated Santa Anna
and captured his whole army,&rdquo; caused an instant outburst of
wild excitement. The wet, weary, and hungry messengers
were dragged on board and questioned by everybody at once.
Captain Brown cried to his gunners: &ldquo;Turn loose old Tom.&rdquo;
Old Tom, the cannon, was fired three times before Captain
Brown remembered that it was the business of the Commodore
to order a salute. &ldquo;Hold on there, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or old
Hawkins will have me in irons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sent Captain Calder and his men over to the flag-ship
<i>Independence</i>, where Commodore Hawkins received them with
enthusiasm and ordered a salute of thirteen guns.</p>
<p>The news spread among the ships and through the fleet of
small boats that swarmed up to hear the story. It passed on
to the land, where people were running about in a wild state of
alarm at the sound of the commodore&rsquo;s guns. Alarm was
changed to joy. The refugees hugged each other, weeping
tears of gladness, and fairly beside themselves with delight.
President Burnet received Captain Calder in his tent and heard
the story of the battle with deep emotion.</p>
<p>The young captain, &ldquo;having changed his clothes,&rdquo; as he
relates, went in search of the bright-eyed girl whom he had not
seen since the war began. As he passed, unknown, through
the groups of men, he heard one man exclaim: &ldquo;What! the
whole Mexican army defeated and Santa Anna taken prisoner?
No, gentlemen; these fellows are scoundrels and deserters. It
is too big a story, and they ought to be taken into custody at
once!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>President Burnet and his suite boarded the <i>Yellowstone</i> the
same day (April 27) and steamed up to the new camp near
Harrisburg, whither Houston had removed his army. There
he met Santa Anna and arranged the basis of a treaty which
the Mexican general signed on the part of his country.</p>
<p>By the terms of the treaty the Mexican army was to withdraw
from Texas soil; hostilities were to cease; American prisoners
were to be released; and all property seized during the invasion
was to be returned to the owners. Santa Anna was to be
liberated at the discretion of the Congress.</p>
<p>On the 3d day of May the Mexican prisoners were placed on
board the <i>Yellowstone</i> and carried to Galveston island, where
they were kept under close guard.</p>
<p>President Burnet accompanied Santa Anna to the coast,
whence it was intended to embark the Mexican general at
once for Vera Cruz.</p>
<p>Soon after the battle of San Jacinto, General Houston, leaving
Rusk, who had recently been appointed brigadier-general,
in command of the army, went to New Orleans to have his
shattered ankle treated by his own physician.</p>
<p>Filisola had heard of the defeat and capture of his commander-in-chief
and was already in full retreat when Santa
Anna&rsquo;s order reached him. He arrived at Goliad about the
20th of May.</p>
<p>Here, on the 26th, Commissioners Benjamin Fort Smith and
Henry Teal found him. They had been sent by President
Burnet with a copy of the treaty between Santa Anna and the
Texan congress for Filisola&rsquo;s signature. He signed it, and
continued his march westward to the Rio Grande.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>On June 4 General Rusk&mdash;who had followed with the Texan
army to see that the Mexicans retreated in good faith&mdash;stopped
at Goliad to fulfill a sacred duty. This was to collect and bury
the remains of the victims of the Palm Sunday massacre.</p>
<p>The charred and sun-dried skeletons scattered about the
ground were gathered together and reverently laid in a pit dug
for the purpose. The army was paraded inside the fort, and
from thence, slowly and with reversed arms, to the beat of muffled
drums, the soldiers marched to the chosen spot. With the
procession walked several of Fannin&rsquo;s men who had escaped
death on that fatal Sunday.</p>

<p>General Rusk began an address, the troops standing around
him. &ldquo;But in truth he did not finish what he intended to say,
for he was overpowered by his feelings, and the tears rolled
down his cheeks, and he had to stop speaking. There were
but few dry eyes on that occasion.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>So powerful was the impression produced on the men who
assisted in this mournful ceremony that General Andrade
(An-dra&prime;d&#257;), who was bringing up the rear of the Mexican
army, was advised by Rusk that it would not be safe for him
to attempt to pass through Goliad, as he could not answer for
what his own men might do. Andrade was therefore obliged
to cut a crossing seven or eight miles long through the chapparal
thickets, in order to reach the main road. The Mexican army
marched slowly westward with trailing banners. San Antonio
and other places held by Mexican garrisons were given up. At
length the Rio Grande was reached and crossed.</p>
<p>The independence of Texas was achieved.</p>

<p>The treaty between Santa Anna and the Texan Congress was
concluded at Velasco (May 14), and to the written paper was
affixed the seal of the Republic.</p>
<p>The choice of this seal was the result of an accident. When
the declaration of independence was adopted at San Felipe,
Governor Smith, having no other seal, used one of the brass
buttons from his coat. Its
device chanced to be a five-pointed
star encircled by a
wreath of oak leaves. The
Lone Star with its wreath thus
became the official signet of
the Texas Republic.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic30">
<img src="images/p29.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="415" />
<p class="caption">Flag of Texas Republic.</p>
</div>
<p>Santa Anna was conducted
on board the war-schooner
<i>Invincible</i>, which had orders
to convey him and his staff to Vera Cruz on the coast of
Mexico. But public feeling was so strong against setting free
the arch enemy of Texas that President Burnet was obliged
to have him brought on shore again. He was sent from
Velasco to Columbia, and thence to Orizaba, the country
place of Dr. Orlando Phelps, on the Brazos River. A plot
for his release was soon afterward discovered. This caused
him to be put in irons, and to receive a small taste of
the ill-treatment he had so often accorded to others. It was
not until after the return of Houston from New Orleans in the
fall that the captive general was finally released.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Meantime there was great dissatisfaction in the army. The
soldiers, having no fighting to do, began to remember that they
were hungry and in rags. They clamored for money which the
poverty-stricken government could not give them; and they
still demanded loudly the death of Santa Anna.</p>
<p>In June Major Isaac Burton, with a company of mounted
rangers on the lookout for Mexican vessels at Copano, succeeded
in decoying into port and capturing three supply ships
which belonged to the enemy. These were the <i>Watchman</i>,
the <i>Comanche</i>, and the <i>Fanny Butler</i>. The supplies, valued at
twenty-five thousand dollars, were sent at once to the army.
This timely relief and the re-imprisonment of Santa Anna
restored the soldiers to good humor.</p>
<p>In September a general election was held. General Houston
was made President, and Mirabeau B. Lamar Vice-President.
The new term was to begin in December; but President
Burnet, glad to lay down the burden which he had borne wisely
and virtuously, resigned his office, and on the 22d of October
Houston was inaugurated.</p>
<p>The ceremony took place at Columbia. Among those present
were many who had been prominent in the revolution: Stephen
F. Austin, ex-Governor Smith, Branch T. Archer, the Whartons,
Mosely Baker, Sidney Sherman, John T. Austin, William Austin,
and many others.</p>
<p>Santa Anna, in his guarded apartment not far away, might
almost have heard the echoes of his old enemy&rsquo;s voice when, at
the conclusion of his address, Houston unbuckled his sword
and handed it to the Speaker of the House, with the assurance
that if his country should ever call for his services again he
would resume his sword and respond to that call with his blood
or his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Stephen F. Austin was made Secretary of State in Houston&rsquo;s
cabinet. He had but lately returned from the United States,
where he had rendered important service to Texas during her
struggle for independence. He now saw his highest hopes
realized. His beloved colonists had become a free people.
His chosen land would now blossom like a rose in the fair
sunshine of peace.</p>
<p>He began his new duties with ardor. But constant anxiety
and the hardships of prison life had left him weak and delicate.
The unfinished room where
he worked was without fire;
he was seized suddenly with
pneumonia, and after a short
illness he died (December
27, 1836).</p>
<p>The Father of Texas was
but forty-three years old.
His life had been noble, useful,
and unselfish, and his
death was a public loss. His
body was conveyed in the
steamer <i>Yellowstone</i> to Peach
Point on the Brazos, near
Columbia. There, in the
presence of the President and his cabinet, the officers of the
army and navy, and a large concourse of citizens, he was buried
with military honors.</p>

<p class="caption">Mirabeau B. Lamar.</p>
</div>
<p>The first regular Congress had a hard task before it. The
people of Texas were in favor of annexation to the United
States. But a strong faction in that nation, though willing to
acknowledge Texas as an independent country, was strongly
opposed to receiving another slave state. The young Republic
was therefore obliged to stand alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>There was a large public debt, but no money in the treasury.
Mexico still laid claim to her rebellious province, and it was
necessary to maintain an army to repel invasion, and a navy to
defend the coast. The Indians were troublesome. The civil
law, in the confusion and disorder of the war, had become
almost a dead letter.</p>
<p>This was a tangled skein, but Congress set to work with
hearty good will to unravel the threads. The legislature provided
for the public debt and other state expenses by issuing
land scrip (government paper entitling the holder to so many
leagues of land).</p>
<div class="img" id="pic32">
<img src="images/p31.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="437" />
<p class="caption">First Capitol of Texas.  At Columbia (1836).</p>
</div>
<p>County and magistrate courts were organized; a Supreme
Court was formed, and the Spanish code of laws was displaced
by the code used by the United States. The soldiers instead
of their pay received permission to go home on long visits to
their families. Some vessels were bought for the navy, and
commissioners were sent to the different Indian tribes to make
treaties of friendship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Congress adjourned in December. The following May it
met in the new town on Buffalo Bayou named in honor of the
President.</p>
<p>Monsieur Le Cl&egrave;re (Le Clare), a Frenchman who visited
Texas about this time, writes thus of Houston: &ldquo;I cannot say
that Houston is a great city, although it is a capital. The
principal street, Main Street, which is laid out in a straight line,
and handsome enough for the country, runs down to the river.
The footwalks are barely marked out. We found the landing
still blocked by enormous trunks of trees. Great southern
pines are left standing in the street. The ascent which leads
from the bayou to the city is very rough, and one stumbles
over the logs that encumber it. By the side of houses of
tolerably fine appearance (though built entirely of wood), one
meets here and there with those poor houses called log cabins.
Finally, as a last touch to this picture, there stand in Main
Street and near the capitol two great tents which would do
honor to a chief of the Tartars or Bedouins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The environs of Houston are not inhabited. A great number
of the people I saw in the city were going further west, but
their passage gave it a very lively appearance. They were
on horseback, and almost all armed with the terrible weapon
called the bowie knife. Most of them carried before them on
the saddle that rifle, excessively long, which they handle with
a wonderful skill, and which Jackson&rsquo;s men used so well at the
battle of New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The capitol building was unfinished, and Congress was
obliged to shorten its sittings when it rained or a &ldquo;norther&rdquo;
blew fiercely through the shutterless windows. The President&rsquo;s
house was a double log cabin with a puncheon floor. But the
naturalist Audubon describes President Houston (May, 1837)
as receiving his guests in this rude cabin, &ldquo;dressed in a fancy
velvet coat and trousers trimmed with gold lace; and around
his neck was tied a cravat somewhat in the style of 1776.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The same writer speaks of the members of the cabinet as
men bearing the stamp of &ldquo;intellectual ability, simple, though
bold in their general appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All sorts of people from at home and abroad thronged the
little capital. Curious
travelers like Audubon
and Le Cl&egrave;re, the
Frenchman, brushed
against hunters clad in
buck-skin, traders with
pack-mules, and eager-eyed
young adventurers
from &ldquo;the States.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic33">
<img src="images/p32.jpg" alt="" width="436" height="600" />
<p class="caption">A Comanche Chief.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>A great many Indians
came into the
town to see their Great
Father, Houston. One
such deputation was
from the hunting-grounds
of the Comanches.
They came to
make their treaty of
peace in person. They
rode mustang ponies,
and brought their
squaws and papooses with them. After setting up their
buffalo-hide lodges on the prairie near the town, the warriors
marched in single file to President Houston&rsquo;s own residence.
They were all tall and finely formed, with very red skin, and jet-black
hair which they wore hanging in long locks down their
backs. These locks were ornamented with bands of silver.
Many of the warriors wore, just below the elbow, clumsy rings
of copper or gold, from which dangled the scalp-locks of their
dead enemies. Monsieur Le Cl&egrave;re, who saw this procession, says
that one young Indian had two of these rings hung with ten or
fifteen heads of hair of different colors. The women wore tight
leggings of tanned buck-skin, with tunics of wolf or jaguar skins,
trimmed with beads and quills. Many strands of colored beads
were strung around their necks, and their hands were loaded
with gold and silver rings. Some of their costumes were graceful
and pretty. The wearers were nearly all old and ugly; but
one young girl, the daughter of the chief, is described as very
beautiful, with liquid black eyes, softly rounded cheeks, and
red laughing lips. She wore on her head a crown made of
eagle feathers, and her girdle was a band of heavy silver discs.</p>
<p>The President welcomed his red brothers gravely and kindly.
The calumet, or pipe of peace, was smoked and the treaty was
made. The Indians received presents of beads, blankets, and
red cloth. The old chief when he rode away carried the Texas
flag tied to a stalk of sugar cane. &ldquo;Me big chief! Houston big
chief!&rdquo; he cried, striking his breast with his hand.</p>
<h3 id="c31">2. THE INVINCIBLE.</h3>
<p>The provisional government of 1835 provided for a navy
to serve the new Republic of Texas. It was not a very formidable
navy. It consisted at first of two vessels&mdash;the schooners
the <i>Invincible</i> and the <i>Liberty</i>. Afterward were added the <i>Independence</i>,
which became the flag-ship of Commodore Hawkins,
commandant of the fleet, the <i>Brutus</i>, and several small sloops,
including the <i>Champion</i> and the <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>These ships cruised about the Gulf of Mexico, watching the
coast and doing what they could with their small guns to annoy
the Mexican war-vessels. Early in April, 1836, the <i>Invincible</i>,
commanded by Captain Jerry Brown, met the Mexican brig,
the <i>Montezuma</i>, near Tampico and fired upon her. A spirited
engagement followed which lasted several hours, and in which
the <i>Montezuma</i> was badly disabled. She drew off, and in
attempting to enter the harbor ran aground.</p>
<p>The <i>Invincible</i> sailed away unhurt, and the next day met and
captured the American brig, the <i>Pocket</i>, which was on her way
to a Mexican port with a cargo of supplies for Santa Anna&rsquo;s
army. Captain Brown brought the <i>Pocket</i> into Galveston,
whence the supplies were forwarded to the army.</p>
<p>The <i>Invincible</i>, lying at that time in the bay, received from
Captain Calder the first news of the victory at San Jacinto, and
Captain Brown at once &ldquo;turned loose Old Tom&rdquo; to express his
own joy therefor.</p>
<p>The <i>Yellowstone</i> came down from the Texan camp and landed
the Mexican prisoners on the island; she then proceeded to
Velasco, having on board the President and his cabinet officers,
and General Santa Anna and his staff.</p>
<p>The <i>Invincible</i> was ordered to follow, and after signing the
treaty, Santa Anna was conducted on board, and Captain
Brown received orders to sail to Vera Cruz with the defeated
general. The Texan commissioners empowered to treat with
the Mexican government were also on board. As already
related, Santa Anna was taken ashore again and placed in
prison. The <i>Invincible</i> with the <i>Brutus</i> was soon afterward
sent to New York for repairs. The <i>Liberty</i> conveyed General
Houston to New Orleans, and was there sold to pay her
war-expenses.</p>
<p>The new Congress was without means to meet the cost of
repairing and refitting the <i>Invincible</i> and her sister ship. They
were on the point of being sold when Henry Swartwout, the
collector of the port of New York, with great generosity provided
the money from his private purse. They were completely
equipped and sent to sea the same year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>In 1837 the entire fleet set out for a cruise in the Gulf
of Mexico. The <i>Champion</i> and the <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> were taken by
the enemy on the 12th of April. Both carried valuable cargoes,
and their loss was a keen blow to the young government.</p>
<p>On the 17th of April the <i>Independence</i> encountered near
Velasco two Mexican brigs of war,&mdash;the <i>Libertador</i>, armed
with sixteen 18-pound guns and manned with one hundred
and forty men, and the <i>Vincedor</i>, with six 12-pounders and
one hundred men. The <i>Independence</i> had but thirty-one men.
The action, in which the Texans behaved with great gallantry,
was a short and severe one. It ended in the capture of the
<i>Independence</i>. The crew were sent as prisoners to Matamoras.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic34">
<img src="images/p33.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="492" />
<p class="caption">Old Capitol at Houston (1837). From an old Print.</p>
</div>
<p>A little later the <i>Invincible</i> and the <i>Brutus</i> captured the
Mexican schooners, the <i>Obispo</i> and the <i>Telegraph</i>. Both boats
were sent in as prizes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>In August the <i>Brutus</i> and the <i>Invincible</i> reached Galveston
with another prize. The <i>Brutus</i> with the prize entered the
harbor safely, but the <i>Invincible</i> did not succeed in passing
the bar. She was attacked the next morning (26th) by two
Mexican ships. The <i>Brutus</i> started out to assist her, but ran
aground and lay helpless on the sand. The <i>Invincible</i> held
her own against the enemy all day; at nightfall she struck on
the breakers. Her crew were saved, but the gallant old ship
went to pieces.</p>
<p>The next year (1838) a new navy was voted by Congress.
Several vessels were bought, but there was now no duty for
them to perform. They were placed in the service of Yucatan,
which was in revolt against Mexico. Some years later, when
Texas was annexed to the United States, they passed into the
navy of that country.</p>
<p>The <i>Brutus</i>, the last ship of the old Texan navy, was lost in
a storm at Galveston Bay as late as 1867.</p>
<h3 id="c32">3. THE CAPITAL.</h3>
<p>One of the laws of the constitution provided that no one
should be allowed to hold the office of President for two successive
terms. Houston&rsquo;s term of office expired in 1838, and
Mirabeau B. Lamar was elected President and David G. Burnet
Vice-President.</p>
<p>The Secretary of War under Lamar was Albert Sidney
Johnston. This brilliant young soldier came to Texas just
after the battle of San Jacinto. He was a graduate of West
Point, and had served in the Blackhawk war.</p>
<p>Johnston at once organized a force to act against the Indians.
Lamar did not have Houston&rsquo;s kindly feeling for the Red
Men. He looked upon them as dangerous enemies, and he
wished to rid the country of them entirely. The Indians, on
their side, had been breaking the treaties made with Houston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Mexico was too full of troubles at home to invade Texas
again. But Mexican agents were sent among the Cherokees
and Comanches to stir them up against the white settlers, and
incite them to reclaim their lands. Many homes on the
frontier were burned, and their peaceable inmates killed or
taken prisoners. The Texas rangers, under General Rusk
and Colonel Burleson, finally defeated and subdued the most
troublesome of the warlike tribes, and the frontier became
quiet once more.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic35">
<img src="images/p34.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="374" />
<p class="caption">First Executive Mansion. At Houston (1837).</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>But in 1840 trouble broke out again with the Comanches.
Twelve chiefs of this tribe came to San Antonio to sign a new
treaty. As usual, they were accompanied by their women and
children. They had promised to bring with them thirteen
white prisoners, but they appeared with but one, a little girl
named Matilda Lockhart, who had been carried away in a raid
on her father&rsquo;s house two years before. The chiefs declared
they had no more prisoners. But the child said there were
others at the camp, who were to be brought in one by one for
large ransom. A company of soldiers was ordered into the
council-room, and the Indians were told that they were prisoners
until the other white captives were given up. One of
the chiefs immediately attempted to escape, stabbing the
sentinel at the door. A furious combat followed, in which the
twelve chiefs were all killed. In the plaza outside there was
also a desperate fight. The Indian women took part in this,
and three of them were killed. Captain Matthew Caldwell,
who was unarmed, defended himself with stones until his
assailant was killed. Judge Thompson, who had been playing
with the Indian children, setting up pieces of money for them
to shoot at, was slain by an arrow from one of their bows.
Colonel Wells came riding into the plaza in the midst of the
skirmish. A powerful Indian leaped on his horse behind him
and tried to shake him off. Unable to do this he seized the
bridle and tried to guide the horse out of the plaza. Colonel
Wells&rsquo;s arms were pinioned so that he could not draw his pistol,
and it was only after careering thus several times around the
plaza that the Indian was shot by a soldier and the Colonel
released. The band was finally overpowered. Thirty-two
warriors, three squaws, and two children were killed; the
others were all made prisoners. This encounter is known as
the &ldquo;Council-house Fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Congress held its meetings in Houston until 1839. But the
site for a new capital had been chosen. It was on the banks
of the Colorado River, on the then extreme frontier. Two
or three pioneer cabins already stood there, and the little
settlement bore the proud name of Waterloo. But bands of
savage Indians still roamed the hills and prairies adjacent.
It was necessary to place guards about the grounds to protect
the masons and carpenters while they were at work on the
capitol building. Among the buildings erected was a blockhouse,
as a refuge for the women and children in case of an
Indian raid. The new capital was named Austin, in grateful
memory of the Father of Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Congress met at Austin for the first time in October, 1839.
Among the important acts of this session was the appropriation
of fifty leagues of land for a state university, and three
leagues to each county for schools.</p>
<p>This Congress also adopted a national flag, the same now
used as the Texas state flag.</p>
<p>The first Lone Star flag was made at Harrisburg, and presented
to a military company in 1835. The star was five-pointed,
white, set on a ground of red. The flag raised by
Fannin on the walls of Goliad when he heard of the declaration
of independence was an azure star in a white field.
Travis and his men, ignorant of the declaration, died fighting
under the banner of the Republic of Mexico.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>England, France, Holland, and Belgium in turn recognized
the independence of the Republic. Texas, in spite of many
drawbacks, was growing in strength.</p>
<p>The last year of Lamar&rsquo;s term of office, however, was clouded
by an unfortunate affair known as the &ldquo;Sante F&eacute; Expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A scheme was set on foot for the occupation of New Mexico,
whose people were said to be anxious to join the Texas
Republic. Its real object was to divert into Texas the rich
trade of Sante F&eacute; with Old Mexico. An expedition was
organized and started from Brushy Creek, near Austin, June,
1841. It was composed of about two hundred and seventy
soldiers, together with a number of traders and adventurers.
The soldiers were under the command of General Hugh
McLeod.</p>
<p>Congress opposed this expedition, but President Lamar
favored it, and sent with it three commissioners as agents of
the government to treat with the people of New Mexico.
General McLeod&rsquo;s brass six-pound cannon was stamped with
the name of the President, Mirabeau B. Lamar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The journey was a long and painful one. The men suffered
from thirst in crossing those barren western plains, where
water is scarce. They had nothing to eat. &ldquo;Every tortoise
and snake, every living and creeping thing was seized upon
and swallowed by the famishing men.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> They were without
guides, and the Indians hung about their camps killing their
pickets and stealing their horses.</p>
<p>When they reached New Mexico they were worn out and
half starved. Instead of being welcomed as liberators they
were looked upon as spies and enemies.</p>
<p>Under promise of good treatment they finally surrendered
to the force sent against them. They were at once thrown
into prison. Later they were sent, chained like criminals, to
the city of Mexico. Several of them died on the march,
unable to endure the brutality of their guards.</p>
<p>The survivors were held as prisoners in Mexican dungeons
until the next year, when by the intervention of the American
minister they were released and sent home.</p>
<h3 id="c33">4. THE WAR OF THE ARCHIVES.</h3>
<p>Houston was elected President of the Republic for the
second time in September, 1841. Edward Burleson was
elected Vice-President.</p>
<p>The new President recommended economy to the government.
There was not a dollar in the treasury. He caused his
own salary to be reduced, and several useless offices were
abolished by his advice. He favored a more friendly attitude
toward the Indians, and the establishment of trading-posts for
them on the frontier. He advised that no active steps be taken
against Mexico, though Texas, he said, should be prepared to
defend herself against that country if necessary.</p>
<p>For Santa Anna, after many turns of fortune, was once more
in power in Mexico, and had declared war against Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>In the spring of 1842 several incursions were made into
Texas by Mexican soldiers. One band, under Rafael Vasquez,
raided San Antonio; another swept the country about Refugio
and Goliad. There was great excitement everywhere.</p>
<p>Excitement of another kind filled the new capital one day
soon after these raids. The citizens, men, women, and children,
swarmed into the streets, looking at each other with
indignant eyes. The blockhouse stood wide open, showing
plainly that the Indians had nothing to do with the trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded a tall hunter, who had just
come in, rifle on shoulder,
from the frontier. He glanced,
as he spoke, from a small
cannon in the street to a
company of mounted rangers,
who seemed to be guarding
some wagons in front of the
Land Office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter enough,&rdquo; replied
a dozen voices at once. &ldquo;Old
Sam Houston has changed
the capital back to Houston
and sent for the archives.
We are determined that the records of the Republic shall
remain in the true capital of the Republic.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic36">
<img src="images/p35.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="410" />
<p class="caption">Texas State Seal.</p>
</div>
<p>This was true. President Houston, believing Austin in its
exposed position was in danger of Mexican raids, had fixed
Houston as the place of meeting for the next Congress.
Perhaps he was not sorry for the chance, for he had a great
affection for the town named for himself. He had also
ordered the archives removed to that place. The people
of Austin had refused to allow their removal. The angry
President had then sent an armed force to take them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>When the loaded wagons turned away from the Land Office
they were greeted by a volley of grape and canister from the
little cannon&mdash;touched off by a woman, Mrs. Eberle. No one
was hurt, and in the confusion the wagons rattled away,
protected by their escort.</p>
<p>The citizens armed themselves and pursued the train. They
came up with it during the night about eighteen miles from
Austin. After a conference between the leaders on both sides,
the rangers agreed to carry the records back to the capital.
The whole party appeared there the next day and were received
with shouts of triumph by the people. The disputed parchments
were placed in the house of the plucky woman who had
fired the cannon, and there they remained until 1845, when the
government finally returned to Austin. This new Waterloo has
come down to us under the title of the &ldquo;War of the Archives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Congress met at Houston in June, 1842. In September a
Mexican army, commanded by General Adrian Woll and numbering
twelve hundred men, invaded Texas. They marched upon
San Antonio, captured it, and made prisoners of nearly all the
citizens and the members of the District Court then in session.</p>
<p>Upon news of this outrage the people everywhere took up
arms. Two hundred and twenty soldiers, including Captain
Jack Hays&rsquo; company of scouts, left Gonzales immediately to
attack Woll. They were commanded by Colonel Matthew
Caldwell. The Mexican general came out to meet them, and
an engagement took place on the Salado River a few miles from
San Antonio. General Woll had six hundred infantry and two
hundred cavalry. As they advanced the Texans received them
with a rattling hail of bullets.</p>
<p>Three times the Mexican infantry charged with great spirit
and coolness; each time they were driven back. They finally
retreated, carrying with them their dead and wounded, and
leaving the Texans in possession of the field.</p>
<p>This victory was offset by the defeat of a company of fifty-three
Texans on their way to join Caldwell. They were
commanded by Captain Nicholas Dawson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>General Woll met these men in his retreat from the river
Salado, and attacked them in a small mesquit thicket where
they were halted. After an unequal contest of half an hour,
Dawson hoisted a white flag. The firing ceased, but as soon
as the surrender took place, the prisoners were set upon by the
Mexican soldiers and many of them killed. Dawson was killed
after he gave up his arms. Out of his fifty-three men, thirty-three
were killed and eighteen were made prisoners. Two only
escaped; one of these, a lad named Gonzales Woods, seized
the lance thrust at him by a Mexican cavalryman, jerked his
assailant to the ground, then leaped upon his enemy&rsquo;s horse
and galloped away.</p>
<p>The morning after these skirmishes General Woll abandoned
San Antonio and returned to the west side of the Rio Grande
River. His prisoners, among whom were Judge Hutchison
and ex-Lieutenant-Governor Robinson, were sent to the Castle
of Perote (P&#257;-ro&prime;t&#257;), a prison near the city of Mexico.</p>
<h3 id="c34">5. THE BLACK BEANS.</h3>
<p>Before the echoes of the bugles which sounded General
Woll&rsquo;s retreat had finally died on the air, volunteers came
flocking to San Antonio eager to pursue him, and determined
to cross the Rio Grande at all hazards and release the Texans
languishing in Mexican prisons.</p>
<p>On the 18th of November seven hundred men, armed and
equipped for a campaign, were assembled in the shadow of
the twin towers of the old Mission Concepcion. General
Alexander Somervell, appointed by President Houston to the
command, put himself at the head of this small army; the
order to march ran down the line, and with a shout the men
set their faces toward the west.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>After several days&rsquo; march they camped at Laredo on the
banks of the Rio Grande River. They expected to cross at
once into Mexico and take the enemy by surprise. But at the
moment when everything seemed to them favorable for this
movement, General Somervell issued an order for his soldiers
to return to Gonzales, where they would be disbanded.</p>
<p>The men were dumfounded. Three hundred flatly refused
to obey the order. The others, after much wrangling, followed
General Somervell to San Antonio.</p>
<p>Captain William S. Fisher was elected colonel in command of
those who remained, and the expedition proceeded down the
Rio Grande to a point opposite the Mexican town of Mier.</p>
<p>Mier was occupied by General Pedro Ampudia (Am-poo&prime;dee-a)
with two thousand troops. On Christmas morning, before
daylight, Colonel Fisher led his men over the river. The
Mexicans came out to meet them, but were forced to retreat
before the hot fire of the Texans. By daylight the Texans had
captured the enemy&rsquo;s cannon and cut their way into the town.
Here the fight went on, hand to hand, from street to street, from
house to house.</p>
<p>But the superior numbers of the enemy enabled them to
keep up the struggle, which lasted seventeen hours.</p>
<p>At the end of that time a flag of truce was sent by General
Ampudia to Colonel Fisher. Fisher had been severely
wounded early in the action; he was weakened by loss of
blood and unnerved by pain; and he advised surrender,
although up to this time his men had been victorious. He
knew General Ampudia, he said, and he answered for his good
faith.</p>
<p>After much discussion the majority of the men agreed to the
surrender. The terms were most honorable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>No sooner were the articles signed and the Texan arms
stacked, than the unfortunate prisoners began to suffer from
the cruelty of their treacherous foes. They were put in irons
and marched to Matamoras, thence to the interior. At the
Hacienda of Salado, beyond Saltillo, they rose upon their
guards, overpowered the soldiers, seized their weapons and
horses, and escaped. But they found themselves in a strange
country. They soon lost their way in the wild mountain
passes, and after enduring great torture from hunger and thirst,
they were finally recaptured and taken back to Salado.</p>
<p>On their arrival there they were met by an order from Santa
Anna. Every tenth man of them was to be shot! One of their
own number who understood Spanish was compelled to read
this order to his companions. The rattle of handcuffs, indicating
the surprise of the startled prisoners, was promptly
silenced by the guards; and, amid a deadly stillness which
succeeded the reading, an officer entered the shed where they
were confined. He carried an earthen jar. The jar contained
one hundred and seventy-five beans (the number of the prisoners).
Seventeen of the beans were black, the others were
white. The jar was placed on a bench and a handkerchief
thrown over it. The roll was then called. Each prisoner
stepped forward as his name was called, placed his hand in the
jar, and drew out a bean.</p>
<p>The black beans in this fatal lottery meant death.</p>
<p>Some of the Mexican officers grew faint as they looked, and
turned away their heads. But others bent forward eagerly, as
if watching the throw of dice in an everyday game of chance.</p>
<p>It was Sunday afternoon, at the hour when the church bells
were everywhere calling the people to vesper prayer, when this
fearful drama began. Not one of the actors in it faltered or
changed color at finding in his hand the black token of death.
When the ordeal was ended, the shackles of the seventeen
doomed men were knocked off. They were then hurried to a yard
adjoining the shed and shot without further ceremony. Their
comrades, crouched against the wall within, heard but too plainly
the whispered prayers, the echoing shots, and the dying groans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>The survivors were carried to the Castle of Perote near the
city of Mexico, where they found the prisoners taken by General
Woll at San Antonio. They were immediately put to convict
labor. &ldquo;They were hitched to a wagon, twenty-five to a
team, and compelled to haul rocks from the mountains to the
Castle of Perote. The prisoners at no time, however, lost their
buoyant spirits, nor did they ever lose an opportunity for fun.
McFall, a powerful man, was put in the lead, and was always
ready to get scared and run away with the wagon. This was
often done, and the corners of the adobe houses always suffered
in such cases. The Mexican officers would laugh, and the
owners of the houses would swear in bad Spanish. The overseers
were kept busy. They
had the power of using the
lash, but they did not do this
very often, as the Texans made
it their business, at the peril of
their lives, to return such civilities
with ample vengeance.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
<p>Several of the prisoners
made their escape. Among
these was Colonel Thomas
Jefferson Green, who had been
Fisher&rsquo;s second in command.
He was bitterly opposed to
the surrender at Mier, and
broke his sword across his knee rather than hand it to General
Ampudia. Mr. John Twohig, of San Antonio, who had been
carried into captivity by Woll, and several of his fellow-prisoners
made a tunnel under the prison wall, through which they succeeded
in getting out of the Castle and thence safe home again.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Mr. Wright of De Witt County was not so lucky. He was a
very large man; after making his preparations for flight, he
crawled into the tunnel, where he got along famously until he
was about half way through. There he stuck fast, equally unable
to go forward or to come back. Finally, with a despairing
effort he slid back an inch or two, then a little further, until at
last bruised, breathless, and torn, he got back into his dungeon,
glad to settle down to prison life once more.</p>
<p>Among the captives was Samuel H. Walker, afterwards
famous as a captain of cavalry in the Mexican war with the
United States.</p>
<p>In September, 1844, these prisoners were finally released by
Santa Anna, at the dying request, it is said, of his young and
beautiful wife.</p>
<p>About the time the Mier expedition started from San Antonio,
the capital was again removed from President Houston&rsquo;s beloved
town on Buffalo Bayou; this time to Washington on the Brazos.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line3"><span class="smaller">(1842-1861.)</span></span></h2>
<h3 id="c35">1. &ldquo;THE REPUBLIC IS NO MORE.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>From 1842 to 1844 the Texan Congress held its meetings at
Washington on the Brazos&mdash;the spot where, a few short years
before, the declaration of independence had been adopted.</p>
<p>The nation born amid the gloom and uncertainty of that
stormy time now stood forth proud in the consciousness of
growing strength, free and full of hope for the coming
years.</p>
<p>An armistice was signed with Mexico (1843) which left the
Republic at peace. The Indians under the wise rule of the
&ldquo;Big White Chief,&rdquo; Houston, made but few outbreaks. Year
by year more fields were fenced in, more orchards and
gardens were planted, more dooryards were set with vine and
rose-tree.</p>
<p>Immigrants poured in. Many came from &ldquo;the States&rdquo;; but
others crossed the wide seas to find homes in that fertile Texas
whose story of struggle and triumph was in everybody&rsquo;s mouth.
Henry Castro, a French gentleman, who was consul-general for
Texas at Paris, obtained in 1842 large grants of land from the
Republic, and brought over five hundred families from France.
These settled on the Medina River west of San Antonio.
Another important colony came from Germany under the
leadership of the Prince de Solms, and founded the thrifty
town of New Braunfels on the Guadalupe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The roads were white with westward-traveling wagons which
stopped to pass the time of day, as it were, with all the little
towns along the way. In those hospitable days small barrels
of tar stood as a matter of course on the sidewalks. Long-handled
dippers floated in the tar, so that the passing wagoner
might help himself and ease his creaking wheels.</p>
<p>As for the wayside houses, their doors were always open to
the wayworn mover and his family. The women and girls
peering out from under the wagon cover, the boys trudging
sturdily along by the driver&rsquo;s side, the dog trotting in the
shadow of the feed trough,&mdash;all these were to the free-handed
pioneers as welcome as kinsmen.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic38">
<img src="images/p37.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="392" />
<p class="caption">Old Capitol at Austin (1839).</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>The newcomers were often struck with amazement at the
curious contrasts they saw on the frontier. &ldquo;You are welcomed,&rdquo;
writes one traveler, &ldquo;by a figure in a blue flannel shirt
and pendant beard, quoting the Latin poets.... You will
see fine pictures on log walls; you will drink coffee from tin
cups on Dresden china saucers. Seated on a barrel, you will
hear a Beethoven symphony played on a rosewood piano. The
bookcase may be half full of books and half full of potatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while the western border thus filling up with settlers
was quiet and unmolested, there was serious trouble over on
the eastern line. A band composed mostly of rough desperadoes
from the old Neutral Ground roamed along the Sabine
River, shooting and killing innocent citizens under the pretext
of punishing theft, negro-stealing, and other offenses. They
called themselves the Regulators. An opposition band, made
up of men as reckless as themselves, undertook in turn to
punish them, and to administer justice generally. These were
known as the Moderators. Between the Moderators and Regulators,
Shelby, Harrison, and the neighboring counties were kept
in a state of terror. Honest men were afraid to venture out of
their own homes; for no one could guess when or upon whom
the so-called justice of these bands would fall. Bloody &ldquo;courts&rdquo;
were held in the swamps, one day by the Regulators, the next,
and perhaps on the same spot, by the Moderators, both equally
cruel and lawless. Wild stories were told of certain leaders in
either gang whose victims were always shot in the left eye; of
others again whose weapon was not the rifle, but poison.</p>
<p>At one time more than a thousand men were engaged in this
feud. In the summer of 1844 the Regulators and Moderators
assembled under arms in fortified camps. An active campaign
was carried on for some weeks, during which more than fifty
persons were killed or wounded. Finally President Houston
ordered out five hundred militia under General James Smith,
and the two factions were disbanded. But it was a long time
before the feud died out entirely.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1844 Anson Jones was elected President of the
Republic. His Secretary of State was Doctor Ashbel Smith.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Dr. Smith, who was a learned and able man, came to Texas
from Connecticut just after the Revolution, and was made
surgeon-general of the army. During Houston&rsquo;s administration,
he represented the Republic at the courts of England and
France. At this time all over Europe there was keen interest
in Texan affairs.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the glory of the young Republic, its people
still wished to be annexed to the United States. They felt
themselves too weak to contend against Mexico in case of
another war, and too poor to keep up the army and navy, and
provide for the expense of a separate government. But the
United States again refused to receive them. Upon this,
France and England offered through Minister Smith to compel
Mexico to acknowledge the independence of Texas, provided
Texas would agree not to unite with any other country.</p>
<p>This offer caused a sudden change of feeling in the United
States. Her jealousy of foreign interference was aroused; and
in the spring of 1845 the United States Congress passed resolutions
admitting Texas into the Union.</p>
<p>President Jones then submitted the question to the people.
A convention met at Austin in July, 1845, to frame a constitution
for the State of Texas. In October the final vote was
taken. It was almost unanimous for annexation.</p>
<p>In February, 1846, President Jones gave up his authority to
J. Pinckney Henderson who had been elected governor of the
new state. This impressive ceremony took place at Austin,
where the capital had been finally established. President
Jones in his farewell address said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Lone Star of Texas, which ten years since arose amid
clouds, over fields of carnage, and obscurely seen for a while,
... has passed on and become fixed in that glorious constellation
which all freemen and lovers of freedom must reverence
and adore,&mdash;the American Union. Blending its rays with its
sister States, long may it continue to shine.... May the
Union be perpetual; and may it be the means of conferring
benefits and blessings upon all the people of the States, is my
prayer. The first act in the great drama is performed. The
Republic of Texas is no more.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>
<p>Many eyes must have grown dim as the closing sentence of
this address was pronounced. Memories must have crowded
thick and fast upon those veterans who listened, hearing at the
same time in a dream the call of bugles and the roll of drums,
the ring of sabers, and the echo of those daring voices which
called into being the Republic of Texas!</p>
<p>Sam Houston and Thomas J. Rusk were elected United
States senators. Rusk, who was a native of South Carolina,
was one of the signers of the Texan declaration of independence.
He was Secretary of War under President Burnet, and
fought gallantly in the ranks at the battle of San Jacinto.
After General Houston&rsquo;s resignation he was made commander-in-chief
of the army. Rusk had taken an active part in the
war against the Cherokee Indians. Later he had been chief
justice of the Republic. He had devoted himself for many
years with great unselfishness to the interests of the Republic.
He continued to serve the State with the same fidelity.</p>
<p>He died by his own hand in 1857. Grief at the death of
his wife was the cause of this fatal act.</p>
<h3 id="c36">2. ACROSS THE BORDER.</h3>
<p>Mexico was indignant at seeing Texas, which she still claimed
as one of her provinces, about to enter the Union. As soon as the
Annexation Bill was passed by the United States Congress, Don
Juan Almonte, formerly aide-de-camp to General Santa Anna,
now the Mexican minister at Washington, D.C., was recalled,
and preparations for war were begun on a grand scale in Mexico.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>In the meantime, the United States government had sent
General Zachary Taylor to Corpus Christi on the Texas coast,
with four thousand troops. He was ordered to march westward
and take up a position on the Rio Grande River, the boundary
line between Texas and Mexico. He was further ordered to
confine himself to Texas soil unless the Mexicans should
attempt to cross the river.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1846 General Taylor began his march
across the country, &ldquo;which appeared like one vast garden wavy
with flowers of the most gorgeous dyes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> Then came a
desert-like waste in which there was neither water nor any
growing thing. &ldquo;The sand was like hot ashes, and when you
stepped upon it, you sank up to the ankles.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></p>
<p>But the region beyond the desert was fertile and inviting.
At the Sal Colorado, a stream thirty miles east of the Rio
Grande, some Mexican soldiers appeared. They insisted that
all the country west of the Colorado belonged to Mexico, and
declared that if the Americans attempted to cross that stream
they would fire upon them. General Taylor paid no attention
whatever to their threats. He led his troops over the Sal
Colorado without further trouble and continued his march
toward the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>There the war began in real earnest. The first battle was
fought at Fort Brown (now Brownsville), opposite Matamoras.
The Americans were victorious. Two other successful engagements,
Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, took place on Texas
territory. Then General Taylor, having received large reinforcements,
entered Mexico and marched upon Monterey, the
great interior city of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>About this time Santa Anna, who had been in exile and
disgrace, returned to Mexico, and was immediately made commander-in-chief
of the Mexican army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Texas furnished her share of men for the war upon her
hereditary foe. Governor Henderson himself entered the
campaign as a major-general of volunteers; ex-President
Lamar and Edward Burleson served upon his staff. Albert
Sidney Johnston commanded a regiment. &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Hays and
George T. Wood, afterward governor of Texas, were also in
command of regiments. Ben McCulloch carried into the war
a company of rangers.</p>
<p>The Texans were in the van in every battle. At the
storming of Monterey they especially distinguished themselves
by their daring and high courage. A participator
in the siege of the city says: &ldquo;In order to dislodge the
skirmishers from the housetops, the Texans rushed from door
to door, breaking through buildings and inside walls; and,
mounting to a level with the enemy, picked them off with their
rifles. Meanwhile those in the streets charged from square to
square amid sweeping showers of grape, cheered on by Lamar,
Henderson, and Jefferson Davis of the Mississippi regiment.&rdquo;
The next day &ldquo;the artillery on both sides raked the streets,
the balls striking the houses with a terrible crash, while amid
the roar of cannon was heard the battering instruments of the
Texans. Doors were forced open, walls were battered down,
entrances were made through stone and brick, and the enemy
were driven from point to point, followed by the sharp crack of
the Texan rifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Ampudia, who had so basely betrayed the trust of
the Texans after their surrender at Mier in 1843, was in command
of the Mexican forces. After three days of desperate
fighting he surrendered the city of Monterey to General Taylor.</p>
<p>The officers commissioned by Taylor to draw up the articles
of capitulation on the American side were Generals Worth and
Henderson (governor of Texas) and Colonel Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>Texas furnished above eight thousand soldiers for this war,
and the &ldquo;murderous ring of the Texan rifle&rdquo; was heard on
almost every field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>In New Mexico, where there was considerable fighting, the
cannon taken from General McLeod in the fatal Sante F&eacute;
expedition in 1841 was discovered by the American soldiers,
where it had been hidden in the mountains. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; says the
record, &ldquo;a six-pounder, bearing the &lsquo;Lone Star&rsquo; of Texas and
the name of her ex-President, Mirabeau B. Lamar.&rdquo; The
Americans adopted it as a
favorite, and used it in firing
their morning and evening
signals. The Lone Star,
they declared, brought them
good luck.</p>
<p>The war ended in the
storming and capture of the
city of Mexico by General
Winfield Scott, commander-in-chief
of the United States
army. Santa Anna, once
more defeated and humbled,
hid himself with the remains
of his army in the
mountain passes of Mexico.</p>

</div>
<p>In one of the last battles of the war Colonel Samuel H.
Walker was killed. This dashing young Texan, had been
again and again selected by General Taylor for dangerous
service, and his gallantry was a by-word in the army. He had
been one of the unfortunate Mier prisoners, and was among
those who overpowered the guard at Salado and escaped, only
to be recaptured. In the death-lottery he had drawn a white
bean, and had afterward endured the miseries of the Castle of
Perote. In the neighborhood of that prison he fell mortally
wounded, but flushed with victory, and soon afterward expired.
&ldquo;Few men were more lamented. When the cry &lsquo;Walker is dead&rsquo;
rang through the company, the hardy soldiers burst into tears.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Mexico signed at Guadalupe, Hidalgo, a treaty with the
United States (February 2, 1848), and abandoned forever all
claim to Texas.</p>
<p>The governors who succeeded Henderson in Texas from
1847 to 1859 were Governors George T. Wood, Hansborough
P. Bell, Elisha M. Pease, and Hardin R. Runnels.</p>
<p>Early in Governor Wood&rsquo;s administration a disagreement
arose between Texas and the United States over Sante F&eacute; and
the surrounding country. This had been a part of Texas, but
was ceded in 1848 by Mexico to the United States with New
Mexico. When the United States took possession of it Texas
protested, and much ill-feeling followed. For a time it seemed
as if the state which had just got into the Union would march
out again.</p>
<p>But the question was settled during Governor Bell&rsquo;s term of
office. The disputed territory was bought by the United
States from Texas for the sum of ten million dollars.</p>
<p>During these years Texas grew in prosperity; all boundary
questions were settled, and the public debt was paid. Settlements
sprung up to the very border. This, however, caused
fresh trouble among the Indians, who from time to time fell
upon isolated settlements, burning the houses and killing the
settlers or carrying them into captivity. As late as 1847 two
hundred Lipans on the war-path swept the western frontier.
In 1848 the Indians in Texas killed one hundred and seventy
persons, carried twenty-five into captivity, and stole six thousand
horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>The Texan rangers were ordered out by Governor Wood to
protect the frontier. The Comanches, the fiercest of the western
tribes, were finally defeated by the rangers under Colonel
John S. Ford. Their chief, Iron Jacket, was killed in a desperate
hand-to-hand combat with Captain S. P. Ross. The chief&rsquo;s tall
form was found, after death, to be encased in a fine coat of
scale armor, supposed to have belonged to some Spaniard in
the days of the conquest of Mexico. Hence his name, Iron
Jacket, and the belief that he could not be killed by the bullet
of the white man. Iron Jacket&rsquo;s little son Noh-po was carried
to Waco, where he was raised by the Ross family. During the
administration of Governor Pease, the legislature gave the
Indians twelve leagues of land and built for them several new
trading-posts along the frontier. Later they were all removed
to the Indian Territory.</p>
<p>Two million dollars were set aside by the state for a permanent
school fund; and a quantity of land was voted for the
support of the deaf and dumb, the blind, the orphan, and the
insane.</p>
<p>A new state capitol, a Land Office, and other public buildings
were erected at Austin.</p>
<p>In 1857 there was an uprising of Texan wagoners against
the Mexican cartmen, who were engaged in hauling goods from
the coast towns to San Antonio. Mexican labor was much
cheaper than any other, and a large number of these teamsters,
who were honest and reliable, were employed by merchants and
planters. The Texan wagoners, failing to drive out Mexican
cartmen by threats, raided them on the roads, drove off their
oxen, broke up their carts, and in some instances killed the
drivers.</p>
<p>Governor Pease, by ordering out a company of rangers to
protect the Mexican teamsters, finally put a stop to the &ldquo;Cart
War,&rdquo; as it was called.</p>
<p>No other trouble marred this bright period. &ldquo;Our inhabitants,&rdquo;
said Governor Pease, in his message to the legislature
in 1855, &ldquo;are prosperous and happy to a degree unexampled
in our former history.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h3 id="c37">3. DYING RACES.</h3>
<p>The Indian tribes who possessed the fair land of Texas
when the white man first set foot on its soil were rapidly dying
out. Some were already extinct, having left hardly a trace to
show where their villages and wigwams had once stood. The
Cenis, that noble nation which welcomed La Salle and nursed
him tenderly when he lay for months &ldquo;sick of a fever&rdquo; in
their midst, and who sheltered the fleeing fugitives from Fort
St. Louis,&mdash;these had entirely passed away. So had the kindly
Coushattis, the friends of Lallemand&rsquo;s colonists; and the Orquisacas,
the Nacogdoches, and all those gentler tribes by
whose help the Franciscan friars had built the earliest missions.
Gone were the music-loving Wacoes from the banks of
the Brazos; and from the Trinity the corn-growing Tehas.</p>
<p>The fierce Carankawaes, once the terror of the coast and
long believed to be cannibals, and the Kiowas, called the
<i>red-eyed</i>, had melted before the coming of the pale-faces, as
the snow melts under the April sun.</p>
<p>But remnants of the warlike western tribes remained. The
Comanches, the Apaches, and the Lipans still hovered like
dark clouds about the frontier. They called themselves <i>Nianis</i>
(live Indians); and though they were taken away by the government
from their hunting-grounds and penned up in a
Reservation (that is, upon lands reserved or set apart for
them), they continued every now and then to swoop down upon
their old haunts, where every rock and bush and hillock was
familiar to them. Even within the past twenty years the
borderman dared not be too far from his rifle.</p>
<p>But the Texas Indian was passing. His tribes were dying
out, as the Mohicans, the Powhatans, and the Alabamas had
died out before them.</p>
<p>With the Red Man, another race, as wild, as noble, and as
free as his, was as slowly drifting to its end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>When La Salle sailed up a certain pleasant stream in 1685,
he called it <i>Les Vaches</i> (the cows), from the number of buffalos
grazing on its banks. They roamed the vast prairies and the
shaded timberland, from the utmost verge of the country on
the north and west to the salt waters of the Gulf. The herds
were so large that the thunder of their hoofs startled the air
and their trampling shook the ground.</p>
<p>As the Indian retreated westward, the shaggy buffalo followed
his moccasined foot; as the savage warriors, who were
as the sands of the seashore for numbers, dwindled away, so
dwindled the buffalo herds.</p>
<h3 id="c38">4. THE TEXAS RANGER.</h3>
<p>The daring and ever-watchful foe of the Texas Indian, the
dashing and ever-ready hunter of the Texas buffalo, was the
Texas ranger. He, too, is passing away before the march of
civilization, and fast becoming a memory only; but a memory
which will live forever in song and story, with the brave, the
generous, and the noble of all times.</p>
<p>The first company of Texas rangers was formed in 1832;
but it was not until the administration of President Burnet
(1836) that this arm of the service was regularly organized and
put into the field.</p>
<p>They became at once a power, and they have since played
an important part in the history of the state. Mounted upon
a swift horse, with a <i>lariat</i> (rope) coiled about the high pommel
of his saddle and a blanket strapped behind him; with his long
rifle resting in the hollow of his arm, and the bridle held
loosely in his hand; erect and graceful, the brim of his slouch
hat hiding the sparkle of his keen eyes,&mdash;the Texas ranger
is a striking and picturesque figure. But he is more than
that. For fifty years and more he has been the terror of
Indian and intruding Mexican, of thief and desperado, of lawlessness
and crime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>The rangers are subject to the call of the government.
&ldquo;But no tap of spirit-stirring drum or piercing fife, no trumpet
call or bugle sound was heard on the border,&rdquo; in those early
days. A rider passed from settlement to settlement, from
home to home; there would be wiping of rifles and moulding
of bullets. Oftener than otherwise
it was the wives and the sisters
and the sweethearts who moulded
the bullets and packed the wallets,
while the men ground their knives
and saddled their horses. Then
with a hurried good-bye, the rangers
were mounted and away; now
on the bloody trail
of the Comanches,
now tracking the
fierce Lipans; to-day
protecting a
lonely frontier cabin,
to-morrow helping
the Mexican teamsters
in the cart war.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic40">

<p class="caption">A Texas Ranger.</p>
</div>
<p>The rangers, during
the war of the
United States with
Mexico, were noted for their courage and gallantry. &ldquo;I have
seen a goodly number of volunteers in my day,&rdquo; a war correspondent
wrote of them at that time, &ldquo;but the Texas rangers
are choice specimens. From the time we left Matamoras until
we reached this place (Reynoso), the men never took off their
coats, boots, or spurs. And although the weather was rainy
and two fierce northers visited us, there was not a minute when
any man&rsquo;s rifle or pistol would have missed fire or he could not
have been up and ready for an attack.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Another writer describes the rangers in camp: &ldquo;Men in
groups, with long beards and mustachios, were occupied in
drying their blankets and cleaning and firing their guns.
Some were cooking at the camp-fires, others were grooming
their horses. They all wore belts of pistols around their waists
and slouched hats, the uniform of the Texas ranger. They
were a rough-looking set; but among them were doctors,
lawyers, and many a college graduate. While standing in their
midst I saw a young fellow come into the camp with a rifle on
his shoulder and a couple of ducks in his hand. He addressed
the captain: &lsquo;Ben,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if you haven&rsquo;t had dinner, you&rsquo;d
better mess with me, for I know none of the rest have fresh
grub to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;captain&rdquo; was Benjamin McCulloch, famous in the
annals of the rangers. He is thus described by Samuel Reid,
one of his own men:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain McCulloch is a man of rather delicate frame,
about five feet ten inches in height, with light hair and complexion.
His features are regular and pleasing, though from
long exposure on the frontier they have a weatherbeaten cast.
His quick, bright blue eyes and thin compressed lips indicate
the cool and calculating, as well as the brave and daring, energy
of the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCulloch was a Tennesseean by birth. His father served
under General Jackson during the Creek war. Ben followed
the trade of a hunter until he was twenty-one years old. In
those days the settlers depended chiefly on bear meat for food.
If a man were a poor marksman he sometimes went without
his breakfast. But young McCulloch was a fine shot; he often
killed as many as eighty bears in the course of a season.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>He came to Texas with David Crockett. A fortunate illness
kept him at Nacogdoches until after the fall of the Alamo, where
Crockett perished. He served in the artillery at the battle of
San Jacinto, and was one of the first to join the &ldquo;ranging
service.&rdquo; He was in almost all the expeditions of his time,
and engaged in nearly all the fights.</p>
<p>The most noted ranger of this period, however, was Colonel
John Coffin Hays, familiarly
known as &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Hays.
Samuel Reid says of him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had heard so much of
Colonel Hays that I was anxious
to meet the commander
of our regiment. On this occasion
I saw a group of gentlemen
sitting around a camp-fire.
Among them were General
Mirabeau Lamar, Governor
Henderson, and General McLeod,
all distinguished men of
Texas whose names are enrolled
on the page of history.
As I cast my eyes around the
group, I tried to single out the celebrated partisan chief;
and I was much surprised to be introduced to a slender,
delicate-looking young man who proved to be Colonel Jack
Hays. He was dressed quite plainly, and wore the usual broad-brimmed
Texas hat and a loose open collar, with a black
handkerchief tied carelessly around his neck. He has dark
brown hair and large, brilliant hazel eyes which are restless in
conversation and speak a language of their own not to be mistaken.
His forehead is broad and high. He looks thoughtful
and careworn, though very boyish. His modesty is extreme.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic41">
<img src="images/p40.jpg" alt="" width="463" height="601" />
<p class="caption">John Coffin Hays</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Colonel Hays was also a Tennesseean. He emigrated to
Texas when but nineteen years of age. His talent as a leader
showed itself early; and at the age of twenty-one (1840) he
was placed in command of the frontier, with the rank of major.
He soon became famous as a fighter of the Indians, by whom
he was both feared and admired. &ldquo;Me and Blue Wing,&rdquo; said
a Comanche chief on one occasion, &ldquo;we no afraid to go anywhere
<i>together</i>, but Captain Jack <i>great brave</i>. He no afraid to
go anywhere <i>by himself</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His regiment of rangers which included McCulloch&rsquo;s company
was foremost in every battle of the war with Mexico.
His word was law with his men. Off duty he was a gay and
pleasant companion; the rangers called him Jack, but there
was something about him which kept them from taking any
liberties with him.</p>
<p>The rangers continued to serve the state after peace was
made with Mexico. In 1862 the legislature passed a law for
the protection of the frontier. This law provided for the raising
of ten companies of rangers of one hundred men each.
Each company was to be divided, and the two detachments stationed
about one day&rsquo;s ride apart, just beyond the settlements.</p>
<p>The command of this regiment was given to Colonel J. H.
Norris. He went at once to the frontier. He distributed his
soldiers from the Red River to the Rio Grande, with orders
for each company to send a scout every day from one station
to the next, the scout to return the following day. This plan
gave a patrol scout from Red River to the Rio Grande every
day. In addition to this, each company kept out a flying scout
all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; remarks an old ranger (E. L. Deaton), &ldquo;was a busy
year for both rangers and Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 8th of January, 1864, five hundred rangers, under
Captains Gillentine, Fossett, and Totten, met and defeated two
thousand Comanche Indians on Dove Creek in what is now
Tom Green County. This was one of the last pitched battles
fought with Indians on Texas soil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>In later years the rangers have served as a sort of state
police. Many a stronghold of cattle thieves has been raided
by them; many a nest of desperadoes has been broken up;
many a bitter neighborhood feud has been settled.</p>
<p>At the present time (1896) there are about two hundred
rangers in the service. They furnish their own horses, and
receive forty dollars a month; their rations and their arms
being supplied by the state.</p>
<p>Some of those noted for steady nerve and daring courage
among the ranger captains of earlier and later times are
Colonel &ldquo;Rip&rdquo; Ford, Lawrence Sullivan Ross (since governor
of Texas, and called by his old comrades &ldquo;Sul&rdquo; Ross), Colonel
&ldquo;Buck&rdquo; Barry, Lieutenant Chrisman, Sergeants J. B. Armstrong
and L. P. Selker, and Captains Tom Wright, Jesse Lee
Hall, and L. B. McNulty.</p>
<h3 id="c39">5. A CLOUD IN THE SKY.</h3>
<p>In the spring of 1848 there appeared on the streets of Austin
a young man wearing a costume which attracted much attention.
It was composed of gray stockings and knee breeches, with a
black velvet tunic and broad-brimmed, gray felt hat. The
rather dashing-looking stranger was evidently French, but he
called himself an Icarian. He was, in fact, on his way from
New Braunfels, where he had been living, to Icaria, a new
settlement near the Cross Timbers in Fannin County.</p>
<p>This settlement was founded by Etienne Cabet (Ca-b&#257;), a
Frenchman who dreamed of establishing a community where
nobody would be rich and nobody would be poor, but all
money and other property would be held in common. Devotion
to women and children, honesty, and the ability and
willingness to work for the good of the brotherhood were the
chief rules of the fraternity. They numbered in France in
1847 many thousand persons of all classes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Cabet obtained from the Peters Immigration Company in
1847 a million acres of land in North Texas. The land was
given to him on condition that a settlement should be made
upon it before the 1st of July, 1848. In January, 1848, the
first cohort, numbering sixty-nine persons, embarked at Havre,
France. They arrived at Shreveport, Louisiana, the following
April. From there they marched on foot to their chosen
home in Texas, carrying firearms, household goods, and
provisions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you could see Icaria!&rdquo; they presently wrote back to
the brotherhood in France. &ldquo;It is an Eden. The forests are
superb; the vegetation rich and varied. We have horses,
cows, pigs, and chickens in abundance.... Many Texans
come to see us. They are good-natured and very honest. We
camp and sleep out of doors. We lock up nothing and are
never robbed.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>Houses were built and fields ploughed and planted. By
midsummer the Icarians in their cosy hamlet were on the lookout
for the second cohort of colonists. But before it arrived
the cholera broke out in Icaria. Many of the settlers died;
nearly all those who were left abandoned their homes in a panic
and returned to New Orleans, where Cabet himself joined
them with several hundred recruits from France. A new
and more fortunate Icarian settlement was finally made in
Missouri.</p>
<p>A few years later (1853) a procession, also composed of
French emigrants, passed along Main Street in Houston.
They had just landed from the steamboat <i>Eclipse</i> on the
bayou at the foot of the street. At their head walked a tall
gentleman in a velvet coat and three-cornered hat. He
carried a drawn sword in his hand, and the tricolored flag
of France floated above his head. His long white hair
streamed over his shoulders. The whole company, men,
women, and children, sung the Marseillaise hymn as they
marched along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>The tall gentleman was the Count Victor Considerant. He
had come with his followers from France to Texas to found a
Phalanstery, a community much like that already attempted
by Cabet. His watchword was &ldquo;Liberty and Equality.&rdquo; The
faces of the emigrants lighted with joy as they traveled away
over the prairies, following this beautiful vision.</p>
<p>They founded their town on the east fork of the Trinity
River, in Dallas County, and called it Reunion. But the
brotherhood soon fell to pieces. The emigrants scattered
over the country, finding it pleasanter to own homes in a land
of true liberty and equality, than to live by the count&rsquo;s fine
theories.</p>
<p>Many descendants both of the Icarians and of Count Considerant&rsquo;s
colonists are to be met with in North Texas.</p>
<p class="tb">Sam Houston succeeded Runnels as governor in 1859.
When he took his seat at Austin, clouds from more than one
quarter were gathering in the clear sky of Texas. Roving
bands of Indians from the Territory came across the border
and murdered in cold blood a number of families. At first
they stole in, made their raids, and dashed back in a single
night. But they grew more and more bold and insolent, until
the governor was obliged to send the rangers to their old work
of watching the frontier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Lawrence Sullivan Ross, afterward governor of Texas, was
at this time a lieutenant in the ranging service. He was a
gallant and dashing soldier. During a raid on the Indians, on
Pease River (1860), he rescued Cynthia Ann Parker, a white
woman, who had been carried away by the Comanches, when
but nine years of age. She had been a captive twenty-four
years and had forgotten her native tongue. She was the wife
of Peta Nocona, a Comanche chief, and the mother of several
children. Lieutenant Ross returned her to her kindred with
her little daughter Ta-ish-put (Prairie Flower). But she was
not happy among these long-unknown white people; she pined
for her dusky adopted kinsmen; and four years after her rescue
she died, little Ta-ish-put soon following her to the Happy
Hunting-grounds. Inanah Parker, one of her sons, became
a Comanche chief.</p>
<p>During this period a Mexican bandit named Cortina crossed
the lower Rio Grande into Texas at the head of four hundred
men. Their object was plunder, and in their forays a great
many innocent people were killed. The governor appealed to
the general government at Washington for protection along the
Mexican border.</p>
<p>The War Department in response ordered Colonel Robert
E. Lee (afterward famous as commander-in-chief of the Confederate
States army), then stationed at San Antonio, to attack
the bandit and drive him out, crossing the Rio Grande, if
necessary, in pursuit.</p>
<p>Some United States troops, with several companies of rangers,
were at once put in the field, and Cortina&rsquo;s band was
soon broken up.</p>
<p>These troubles were light, however, compared with those
which were about to follow.</p>
<p>The two sections of the United States, the North and the
South, had for some years been drifting apart. Their views
differed widely on several important questions, particularly
the question of states&rsquo; rights, and there seemed to be no
chance of a mutual agreement. In 1860, at the time Abraham
Lincoln was elected President, the Southern States determined
to withdraw from the Union. They believed that each state
had a right to withdraw or secede from the Union whenever
that Union became for any reason undesirable to it, as the
individual members of a family may leave the paternal home if
they wish to do so. But the Northern States did not agree to
this. They believed that the Union should be preserved, and
that the states should be held together&mdash;even by the power of
the sword.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union.
Texas, on hearing of this news, was filled with excitement.
Military companies were formed all over the state; the air
was thick with the flutter of secession flags; the ground
echoed the tramp of awkward squads drilling under the eyes
of officers as awkward and inexperienced and enthusiastic as
themselves.</p>
<p>Governor Houston, as well as some other patriotic and true-hearted
Texans, was bitterly opposed to secession, but his
voice was lost in the loud clamor of public feeling.</p>
<p>A convention was held in Austin in January, 1861. A
declaration of secession was drawn up and submitted to the
people (February 23). Texas by a large majority voted herself
out of the Union, which she had entered fifteen years
before.</p>
<p>There was wild rejoicing over the state. The capitol at
Austin was brilliantly illuminated, bonfires were lighted, bells
were rung, the Confederate flag was run up on all public
buildings, and the work of
mustering troops into the Confederate
States army instantly
began.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic42">

<p class="caption">Confederate Flag.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>All state officials were required
to take the oath of fealty
to the new government. Governor
Houston, true to his
convictions, refused to do this.
When the day came for the
ceremony (March 16), the hall of representatives was filled to
overflowing. &ldquo;The presiding officer, amid a profound silence,
called three times: &lsquo;Sam Houston! Sam Houston! Sam Houston!&rsquo;
but the governor remained in his office in the basement of the
capitol whittling a pine stick, and hearing the echo of the
noise and tumult above his head. Houston was declared
deposed from his office, and Edward Clark, the lieutenant-governor,
was installed as governor.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>Houston left Austin and retired to his place near Huntsville.
To the end of his life he continued to declare that,
although opposed to the war of the States, his sympathies were
with Texas. &ldquo;My state, right or wrong,&rdquo; he said. One of
his sons entered the Confederate army with his consent and
approval.</p>
<p>He died July 26, 1863, at the age of seventy years. His
last words, whispered with dying lips, were: &ldquo;Texas! Texas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Texas, forgetting all her differences with him, and
remembering only his ready and gallant services in her hours
of need, mourned his loss as that of a well-beloved son.</p>

<h3 id="c40">1. A BUFFALO HUNT.</h3>
<p>The early months of the year 1861 in Texas were like one
long holiday. The country was dotted with white tents where
the recruits were encamped, and where, amid bursts of martial
music and in all the glory of brand new uniforms, the untried
volunteers received their mothers and sisters, and showed them
with pride &ldquo;how soldiers live in time of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every few days one of these camps would be broken up, the
tents and camp baggage would be loaded on wagons, and the
&ldquo;boys&rdquo; would march to the nearest town. There the whole
population would be gathered to greet them; a flag would be
presented to them by the hand of some bright-eyed girl, loud
cheers would echo on the air, and the company would tramp
steadily away to take its place in the fighting ranks of the
Confederate States army.</p>
<p>Many of these soldiers carried their negro body-servants with
them; all had abundant stores of clothing and bedding, and
of those little comforts and luxuries that only mothers know
how to provide. Their young faces were eager, their eyes
were sparkling, and if there were sobs in their throats as they
said those last good-byes, the sobs were smothered in the ringing
cheers which mingled with the notes of &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
Bonnie Blue Flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were soon to learn in many a tentless camp, on many
a foot-sore march, on many a bloody and hard-fought field, how
soldiers really live in time of war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>But the days as yet were like one long holiday, although
mother-hearts ached in secret dread, and the scarred veterans
of the Texan revolution and of the Mexican War were filled
with inward forebodings for the future.</p>
<p class="tb">People along the frontier had been talking for some time
about a great buffalo hunt which was to take place that winter
in the Pan Handle. John R. Baylor, a noted hunter and
scout, had, it was said, raised more than a thousand men to go
on this hunt, and a great many scouts and Indian fighters had
joined him. Among them was Ben McCulloch, who had done
such gallant service in Mexico under General Taylor.</p>
<p>The buffalo hunt did not take place; but Colonel Ben
McCulloch, with the buffalo hunters, a thousand or more
strong, appeared in San Antonio on the 15th of February
(1861).</p>
<p>General David E. Twiggs, United States army, was at that
time in command of the troops in Texas. San Antonio was the
most important of the United States army posts in the southwest;
a large amount of military stores was in the arsenal, and
soldiers were kept there ready to march at need to the relief of
the frontier forts.</p>
<p>Colonel McCulloch, acting under orders of commissioners
from Austin, demanded the surrender of all military posts and
supplies in the State of Texas. General Twiggs on the 18th
of February made a formal surrender of the department.
The United States troops were paroled and marched to
Indianola on the coast, where the <i>Star of the West</i>, an
unarmed United States steamer, was waiting to take them
home.</p>
<p>But when they reached Indianola (18th of April) the <i>Star of
the West</i> and the gunboat <i>Mohawk</i>, which had been guarding
her, had both disappeared. The officer in command was in a
quandary. He did not know what to do. At length he placed
his troops on two schooners and sailed across the Matagorda
Bay to the Gulf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>In the meantime, on the 12th of April, at Fort Sumter,
South Carolina, the first gun of the Civil War had been fired.
The struggle between the States had begun.</p>
<p>General Earl Van Dorn, of the Confederate army, was at
this time in command of the military department of Texas.
His headquarters were at Galveston. The island which the
pirate Lafitte had left lone and deserted when he sailed away
in the <i>Pride</i> now teemed with a busy and prosperous people.
The huts of Campeachy were replaced by stately mansions,
and beautiful gardens bloomed where sandy wastes had been.</p>
<p>Several companies of soldiers were encamped without the
city, awaiting marching orders. General Van Dorn entered
the camp one day, and after a brief speech called for volunteers
for an expedition which he was about to undertake. The
Galveston Artillery, the Island City Rifles, and an Irish company
called the Wigfall Guards, at once stepped forward, eager
for duty.</p>
<p>The next night (17th of April), about midnight, the steamboat
<i>General Rusk</i>, with these volunteers on board, drew up
alongside the <i>Star of the West</i>, lying in the Gulf of Mexico, off
Indianola. Captain Howe, of the United States steamer,
hearing himself hailed, came on deck, and supposing these to
be the United States troops he was expecting, he politely
ordered the <i>General Rusk</i> to be made fast to his own boat.
In a twinkling the Confederate soldiers were aboard of the
<i>Star of the West</i> demanding its surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what flag am I asked to surrender?&rdquo; asked the astonished
captain. Ensign Duggan of the Wigfall Guards displayed
the Lone Star flag of Texas, and in his richest brogue exclaimed:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Look at it, me byes. Did ye iver see the Texas
flag on an Irish jackstaff before?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Captain Howe, having neither arms nor soldiers, surrendered,
and the <i>Star of the West</i> followed the <i>General Rusk</i> to
Galveston.</p>
<p>This was why the United States troops the next morning
(April 18) found no steamer to carry them away. The two
schooners upon which they embarked were also captured
several days later, having on board eight hundred officers
and men, with three hundred fine rifles and a large quantity
of camp supplies.</p>
<p>But the Confederacy had no means of protecting the long
stretch of Texas coast. In July a blockading squadron&mdash;that
is, a fleet of armed vessels to prevent ships from entering or
leaving the harbor&mdash;was stationed in the Gulf off Galveston,
and in a short time the whole coast was closely guarded.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1861 Frank R. Lubbock, who has been called
the &ldquo;war governor&rdquo; of Texas, was elected governor. By the
close of his term ninety thousand Texan soldiers were in the
Confederate army.</p>
<p>Early in 1862 a Texas brigade, under General Sibley, was
defeated by the Union forces in New Mexico, and forced to
retreat to San Antonio with a loss of five hundred men.</p>
<p>In October of the same year the Confederates, unable to
hold Galveston, surrendered that place to Commodore Eagle
of the blockading squadron, and withdrew to Virginia Point
on the mainland about six miles distant. Many of the citizens
of the town also left their homes; and amid a silence almost as
profound as that in which Lafitte landed on the island nearly
fifty years before, several hundred soldiers stepped ashore from
their boats and took possession of the place. The United
States flag was hoisted on the Custom-house; the soldiers
settled into their quarters on one of the wharves; the imposing
vessels of the Federal squadron filled the bay and the
harbor. A mournful cry echoed throughout Texas: &ldquo;Galveston
has fallen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<h3 id="c41">2. THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.</h3>
<p>The holiday look had long since disappeared from Texas.
No battles had been fought within her borders, but the blood
of her brave sons had dyed the sod of many a battlefield elsewhere.
For the deadly conflict was raging. The North and
the South, fighting as brother against brother, were pouring
out their kindred blood day by day; the smoke of their hostile
guns darkened the very heavens. Many heroic deeds were
done on both sides&mdash;deeds which to-day thrill us with wonder
and admiration.</p>
<p>But there were frightful gaps in the ranks of those who had
marched away from Texas to the tune of &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
Bonnie Blue Flag.&rdquo; The gallant lads who had showed off
their brave uniforms in the holiday camps were tramping about,
barefoot, ragged, and hungry, in Virginia, in Tennessee, in
Georgia,&mdash;wherever there was an enemy to be attacked or
an outpost to be held.</p>
<p>Their mothers and sisters at home were making lint and
cartridges, weaving and wearing homespun, making their own
shoes and gloves, and cheering the far-away &ldquo;boys&rdquo; with
letters and with home-made gifts, and praying, praying always.</p>
<p>There were few able-bodied men left in the state. The
women with the old men and boys, aided by the negroes who
remained loyal and trustworthy, made the crops. As the war
went on the prices of everything rose. Old bills show that
forty dollars a yard (Confederate money) was paid for calico
for a little girl&rsquo;s &ldquo;best&rdquo; dress; and seventy-five dollars was
paid for a boy&rsquo;s first pair of boots. A war-time arithmetic has
among its examples the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cavalryman paid 200 dollars for his pistol and 4000
dollars for his horse; how much did both cost him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At 20 dollars a pound, how much coffee can you buy for 40
dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;If one hat costs 120 dollars, how much would eight hats
cost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coffee and tea were replaced by drinks made of parched
potatoes, or burnt peas, and sassafras roots. The real articles
which were brought into the country occasionally by blockade-runners
were known as &ldquo;blockade&rdquo; coffee and tea, and were
kept for the use of the sick.</p>
<p>The blockade-runners were very daring and confident.
Captain Henry Sherffius of Houston, among others, was noted
for his skill in slipping through the line of big ships on watch
along the coast of Texas. Once, when he was leaving on one of
his trips, he was so sure of himself and his boat that he invited
his friends to come to his wedding on a certain day some
weeks later. He came back at the appointed time, bringing
with him his wedding-cakes, baked in Vera Cruz, Mexico.</p>
<p>The Mississippi River rolled, a wide barrier, between the two
parts of the Confederacy. Its banks were lined with Federal
sharp-shooters, and its yellow waters were dotted with Federal
gunboats. It was difficult to get news from the eastern side,
where the greater part of the fighting was done, and terrible were
the times of waiting between the first rumors of a battle and the
receipt of the lists of the killed and wounded. A noble and
patriotic citizen of Houston, E. H. Cushing, rendered a priceless
service to Texas in this matter. He was at that time and had
been for years the editor of the <i>Houston Telegraph</i>. His energy
and his devotion to the Confederate cause were unceasing. He
established a pony express between the seat of war&mdash;wherever
that chanced to be&mdash;and Texas. His messengers somehow
managed to get through the lines when no one else could do
so. They went and came, carrying and bringing papers and
dispatches, and above all, precious letters from the boys in
gray. Mr. Cushing&rsquo;s express also &ldquo;ran&rdquo; to Brownsville.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>At the close of the war this true patriot supplied money
from his private purse, not only to broken-down and crippled
home-coming Confederate soldiers, but to the home-going
Federal prisoners from Camp Ford.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Telegraph</i> came out daily throughout the war, some of
its later numbers being printed on coarse yellow, red, and
blue paper.</p>
<p>Amid all the anxiety and hardship there was no thought of
giving up. The men of the South believed themselves to be
fighting for a just cause; the Northern soldiers were equally
sincere in their convictions. And so the war, grim and terrible,
went on.</p>
<p class="tb">In the fall of 1862 General Magruder, Confederate States
army, assumed command of the Trans-Mississippi (that is,
west of the Mississippi) Department. He determined at
once to attempt the recapture of Galveston. He went to
Virginia Point, where the Confederate troops were camped,
and there with great caution and secrecy made his plans.</p>
<p>At the head of Galveston Bay, the <i>Neptune</i> and the <i>Bayou
City</i>, two small steamboats, were bulwarked with cotton bales,
mounted with cannon, and manned with sharp-shooters from
the Confederate States cavalry and artillery. The <i>Lady Gwinn</i>
and the <i>John F. Carr</i> were detailed to accompany these vessels
as tenders. This crude fleet was commanded by Captain Leon
Smith who had served in the navy of the Texas Republic.</p>
<p>About midnight on the 31st of December, the boats moved
down the bay to a position above the town, where they quietly
awaited General Magruder&rsquo;s signal gun.</p>
<p>Magruder had already crossed his troops to the island.
They marched swiftly through the deserted streets of the city,
and, by the light of a waning moon, planted their batteries.
At five o&rsquo;clock on New Year&rsquo;s morning, 1863, the attack began.
It was a complete surprise to the Federals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>The ships of the blockading fleet, under the command of
Commodore Renshaw, were nearly all within the bay. The
<i>Harriet Lane</i>, commanded by Commodore Wainwright, was lying
near the wharf. At a little distance was the iron-clad <i>Westfield</i>,
Commodore Renshaw&rsquo;s flag-ship, attended by the <i>Owasco</i>; still
further out were the armed vessels, the <i>Clifton</i> and the <i>Sachem</i>,
and the barges the <i>Elias Park</i> and the <i>Cavallo</i>.</p>
<p>The war-ships answered the fire of Magruder&rsquo;s batteries
with a terrific hail of iron; once the Confederate gunners were
driven from their guns. But the <i>Neptune</i> and the <i>Bayou City</i>
steamed up to the <i>Harriet Lane</i> and attacked her at close
quarters, pouring a hot fire into her from behind the rampart
of cotton bales.</p>
<p>The <i>Neptune</i> with a hole in her hull made by a cannon-ball
soon sank in shallow water. The <i>Bayou City</i> was also disabled.
The Confederate sharp-shooters leaped on board the <i>Harriet
Lane</i>, and, after a bloody fight on her deck, captured her.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a>
Commodore Wainwright was killed early in the action. First
Lieutenant Lea was mortally wounded.</p>
<p>The Union infantry made a gallant resistance to the land
attack, but they were finally obliged to surrender.</p>
<p>The <i>Sachem</i>, the <i>Clifton</i>, and the <i>Owasco</i> stood out to sea and
escaped. The <i>Westfield</i> ran aground and was blown up to prevent
her capture. Commodore Renshaw and his officers had
left the vessel, but their boats were too near when the explosion
took place prematurely, and they perished with her. The
<i>Harriet Lane</i> and the barges, with several hundred prisoners,
remained in the hands of the victors.</p>
<p>The loss in this battle on the Confederate side was twelve
killed and seventy wounded. The Federals lost one hundred
and fifty killed and many wounded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Among the mortally wounded were two young soldiers, the
story of whose death even yet stirs the heart to pity. One fell
fighting under the starry cross of the Confederacy. The
other dropped on the bloody deck of the <i>Harriet Lane</i> under
the shadow of the stars and stripes. The Confederate was
Lieutenant Sidney Sherman, son of the gallant veteran, General
Sidney Sherman, who led the infantry charge at San Jacinto.
The lieutenant was hardly more than a boy. The blood oozed
from his wounds as he lay dying, but the smile of victory
parted his lips. Suddenly his blue eyes grew soft and tender;
&ldquo;Break this gently to my mother,&rdquo; he whispered. These were
his last words.</p>
<p>The young Union soldier was Edward Lea, first lieutenant
of the <i>Harriet Lane</i>. His wounds were also fatal. But as his
life was ebbing away he heard his name spoken in a tone of
agony. He opened his eyes. His father, Major Lea of the
Confederate army, was kneeling beside him. Father and son
had fought on opposite sides that dark New Year&rsquo;s morning.
The pale face of the young lieutenant lighted with joy; and
when a little later the surgeon told him he had but a moment
to live, he answered with the confidence of a little child and
with his latest breath, &ldquo;My father is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two lads cold in death rested almost side by side on
their funeral biers that day,&mdash;brothers in death, brothers forever
in the memory of those who looked upon their calm
young faces.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Lea and Commodore Wainwright were buried
with military honors from General Magruder&rsquo;s headquarters,
Major Lea reading the service for the burial of the dead.</p>
<p>The body of young Sherman was carried to his beloved
mother, who in her home on the bay had listened with a beating
heart to the cannonading of the battle in which her son&rsquo;s
brave young life had ended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<h3 id="c42">3. HOME AGAIN.</h3>
<p>A small earthwork called Fort Griffin had been built by the
Confederates on the Texas side of Sabine Pass at the mouth
of the Sabine River. It was protected by five light guns and
garrisoned by the Davis Guards, a company from Houston
commanded by Captain
Odlum. The first lieutenant
of the company was Dick
Dowling, an Irishman but
twenty years of age.</p>
<p>Fort Griffin, though small,
was a place of much importance.
Sabine Pass was a sort
of outlet for the pent-up Confederacy.
Blockade-runners,
in spite of the Federal ships
stationed in the Gulf, were
always slipping out of the
Sabine River, loaded with
cotton for Cuba or Europe,
and stealing in with arms
and supplies from Mexico.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic43">
<img src="images/p42.jpg" alt="" width="484" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Richard Dowling.</p>
</div>
<p>Soon after the battle of Galveston, Major Oscar Watkins,
Confederate States navy, was sent by General Magruder with
two cotton-clad steamboats, the <i>Josiah Bell</i> and the <i>Uncle Ben</i>,
to annoy the blockading fleet at Sabine Pass. After a skirmish
and an exciting chase, he succeeded in capturing two United
States ships, the <i>Velocity</i> and the <i>Morning Light</i> (January 21,
1863).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>The United States then determined to take Fort Griffin and
land at Sabine Pass a force large enough to overawe that part
of the country. Twenty-two transports carried the land troops,
about fifteen thousand in number, to the Pass. Four gunboats,
the <i>Sachem</i>, the <i>Clifton</i>, the <i>Arizona</i>, and the <i>Granite City</i>,
accompanied them, to bombard the fort and cover the landing
of the soldiers. The expedition was under the command of
General Franklin.</p>
<p>When this formidable fleet appeared at Sabine Pass, Captain
Odlum was absent and Lieutenant Dowling was in command
of Fort Griffin. His whole force consisted of forty-two men. He
ordered the &ldquo;Davys,&rdquo; as they were called, to stay in the bombproofs
until he himself should fire the first gun. Then,
hidden by the earthwork, he watched the approach of the gunboats.</p>
<p>The <i>Clifton</i> steamed in and opened the attack from her pivot
gun, throwing a number of shells which dropped into the fort
and exploded. The <i>Sachem</i> and the <i>Arizona</i> followed, pouring
in broadsides from their thirty-two-pound cannon.</p>
<p>No reply came from the fort, which seemed to be deserted.
The gunboats came nearer and nearer. Suddenly a shot from
the fort clove the air and fell hissing into the water beyond the
<i>Arizona</i>. The fight at once became furious. The <i>Clifton</i> and
the <i>Arizona</i> moved backward and forward, vomiting huge shells
which tore the earthwork of the fort and filled the air with dust.
Ships and fort seemed wrapped in flame. The <i>Sachem</i> meanwhile
was stealing into the Pass toward the unprotected rear
of the fort. But a well-aimed shot from Dowling&rsquo;s battery
struck her, crushing her iron plating and causing her to rise on
end and quiver like a leaf in the wind. She was at the mercy
of the fort, and her flag was instantly lowered. The <i>Clifton</i>
kept up the fight with great skill and bravery. But she soon
ran aground in the shallows, where she continued to fire until
a shot passed through her boiler, completely wrecking her.
A white flag was run up at her bow, and the battle was
over. The <i>Arizona</i> and the <i>Granite City</i> steamed out to the
transports, whose men had watched the fight with breathless
interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>The fleet at once retired, leaving the <i>Sachem</i> and the <i>Clifton</i>
to the &ldquo;Davys.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
<p>Three hundred Union soldiers were taken prisoners. Captain
Crocker of the <i>Clifton</i> came ashore with a boat&rsquo;s crew,
and, mounting the parapet, asked for the commanding officer.
Lieutenant Dowling, covered with the dust of the fort, presented
himself as the person sought.</p>
<p>The gallant Federal in his handsome uniform could hardly
believe that this dirty little boy was his conqueror, or that the
handful of men before him comprised the force which had so
calmly awaited a hostile fleet and defeated it.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>
<p>Eight months afterward the United States gunboats, the
<i>Granite City</i> and the <i>Wave</i>, were captured at Sabine Pass.</p>
<p>In November and December, 1863, General Banks took
possession of the Texas coast, protecting it with a land force
from Brownsville to Indianola. Within a short time, however,
he withdrew his troops, leaving only a garrison at Brownsville.
But the cruel war was fast drawing to a close. The Confederate
army, thinned in ranks and in need of food, as well as of
powder and of shot, could no longer be maintained. There
were no men to take the place of those who fell in battle; the
untilled fields gave no harvests; the coasts were so guarded
that the most reckless blockade-runner, could no longer get in
with supplies. On the 9th of April, 1865, General Robert E.
Lee, commander-in-chief of the Confederate army, surrendered
to General U. S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in
Virginia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Before this news reached Texas the last skirmish of the war
had taken place near Brownsville (April 13) between some
of Banks&rsquo; soldiers and a party of Confederates. The scene of
this skirmish was the old battlefield of Palo Alto.</p>
<p>On the 30th of May Generals Kirby Smith and Magruder
went on board the United States ship <i>Fort Jackson</i> at Galveston
and made a formal surrender of the Trans-Mississippi
Department.</p>
<p>On the 19th of June General Granger, United States army,
took command at the island and announced the freedom of the
negroes.</p>
<p>The great Civil War was over.</p>
<p>Several thousand Texans lost their lives in the Confederate
States army during the four years&rsquo; war. Among the distinguished
dead were General John Gregg, first general of Hood&rsquo;s
brigade, Colonels Tom Lubbock and Tom Green, the famous
scout Ben McCulloch, General Granbury, Colonel Rogers, and
many others. To these may be added General Albert Sidney
Johnston, always claimed by Texas as her son, and who in
death rests upon her bosom.</p>
<p class="tb">The war was over. The ragged, foot-sore, hungry soldiers
who had so proudly worn the gray began to come home.
Many who had gone away round-faced boys came back lank
and hollow-eyed men. Many were maimed and crippled;
many were sick; all were forlorn and discouraged. They saw
with despair their weed-grown fields, their dilapidated houses,
and rotting fences. The wives and mothers, whose husbands
and sons had laid down their lives for a lost cause, looked at
the more fortunate wives and mothers whose husbands and
sons had been spared to them, and wept. And all wondered
how they could ever take up their ruined lives again.</p>
<p>But time is merciful. The gloom did not last always. The
Blue and the Gray clasped hands before many years had
passed, and once more the Lone Star of Texas blazed in a
cloudless sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c43"><span class="h2line1">IX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A FLIGHT OF YEARS.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3"><span class="smaller">(1865-1900.)</span></span></h2>
<p>The time indeed came when the Blue and the Gray joined
hands, and the Lone Star shone once more in a cloudless sky.
But that time was not yet. The years which followed the Civil
War were bitter and sorrowful ones for Texas.</p>
<p>After the surrender General Granger continued to hold
military possession of the state.</p>
<p>Before his arrival Pendleton Murrah, who had succeeded
Lubbock in 1863, had left his office in the hands of the lieutenant-governor
Fletcher S. Stockdale, and gone to Mexico.</p>
<p>Andrew J. Hamilton was appointed provisional governor by
President Johnson. He arrived at Galveston in July (1865),
and at once assumed the duties of his office.</p>
<p>He ordered an election of delegates to a convention which
was called for the purpose of framing a new constitution.</p>
<p>But no man was allowed to vote who had borne arms
against the United States. The majority of Texas men had
fought against the Union; they therefore took little interest in
an election of delegates for whom they could not vote.</p>
<p>The convention met (February, 1866), the new constitution
was drawn up and submitted for ratification to such of the
people as were &ldquo;loyal to the United States, and none others&rdquo;;
and in June James W. Throckmorton was elected governor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>A few months later the United States government decided
to place the state again under military rule. Louisiana and
Texas were constituted a Military District with headquarters at
New Orleans. General Philip Sheridan was placed in command,
and General Charles Griffin was ordered to Texas with
several thousand troops to enforce military rule (March, 1867).
His headquarters were at Galveston.</p>
<p>All elections except those under control of his officers were
forbidden by General Griffin. An oath, known as the &ldquo;iron-clad
oath,&rdquo; was required of all voters. The newly freed negroes
were for the first time
placed on juries and
encouraged to vote.</p>
<p>It was during this time
that the remains of the
great soldier General
Albert Sidney Johnston
were removed from New
Orleans to Austin for
final burial.</p>
<p>At Houston, when the
funeral train rolled into
the station, it was met
by a procession of five
hundred ladies and little
girls. The coffin was
borne to the old Houston
Academy, where for a
day and night it lay in state, amid the mournful tolling of bells.</p>
<p>In July Governor Throckmorton, upon reports made by
General Griffin, was removed from office by General Sheridan,
and E. M. Pease appointed in his place.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic44">
<img src="images/p43.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="599" />
<p class="caption">General Albert Sidney Johnston.</p>
</div>
<p>In September, 1869, Governor Pease, vexed and wearied by
the strife and discord around him, resigned his thankless office.
For a time there was no governor, a military adjutant performing
the duties of the place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>In 1870 Edmund J. Davis was inaugurated governor and
held the office four years. He was succeeded in 1874
by Richard Coke, with Richard B. Hubbard as lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>The dark and stormy period from the surrender to the close
of Governor Davis&rsquo; term of office has since been known in
Texas as the &ldquo;Reconstruction Time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time of Governor Davis&rsquo; election, the military was
finally withdrawn from the state, the citizens were restored to
their civil rights, and Texas was readmitted to the Union.
During his administration a Homestead Law was passed, a
one-per-cent tax was levied for the building of schoolhouses,
and the growth of railroads was encouraged by liberal grants
of land.</p>
<p>But there was still a great deal of trouble and discontent,
and it was not until Governor Coke took his seat that the state,
so long shaken by contention, began once more to breathe
freely and to put forth the strength within her.</p>
<p>Governor Coke served from 1874 to 1876; in 1876 he was
elected to the United States senate, and Richard B. Hubbard
became governor (1876-1879).</p>
<p>The governors who guided the Ship of State from 1879 to
1895 were Oran M. Roberts (1879-1883), John Ireland<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> (1883-1887),
Lawrence S. Ross (1887-1891), and James S. Hogg
(1891-1895).</p>
<p>In 1894 Charles A. Culberson became governor, and in 1896
he was returned by a large majority to the same office. On his
election by the legislature in 1897 to the senate of the United
States, he was succeeded by Joseph D. Sayers, who was the
chief executive of the great state of Texas at the close of the
nineteenth century.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>These years have been marked by many wonderful changes
in Texas. Not the least of these changes has been the
growth of the great public school system. The first free school
in Texas was opened at San Antonio in 1844. A state public
school system was organized in 1870. From these imperfect
beginnings to the admirable system of to-day, when an army
of earnest and gifted men and women are banded together in
the noble work of teaching, and countless multitudes of children
pass daily in and out of the schoolroom,&mdash;from that gray
dawn to this blazing noontide, what a change!</p>
<p>The cause of education has indeed been ever in the minds
and hearts of the people.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic45">
<img src="images/p44.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="484" />
<p class="caption">The Sam Houston Normal Institute.</p>
</div>
<p>An Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded at
Bryan, and opened in 1876.</p>
<p>In 1879 a State Normal School for teachers, called the
Sam Houston Normal Institute, was established at Huntsville,
Governor Houston&rsquo;s old home. A few years later the Prairie
View, a normal school for colored teachers, was established.</p>
<p>A State University was founded in 1881. The fine group of
buildings crowning one of Austin&rsquo;s green hills was finished and
thrown open to the young men and women students of the state
in 1883.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>The first president of the University Board of Regents was
Doctor Ashbel Smith. After his services to the Texan Republic,
Doctor Smith devoted himself to scientific study and to the
free practice of the medical profession. In 1861 he enlisted
in the Confederate States army. He was elected a captain in
the second Texas regiment of infantry, and was promoted to
the colonelcy on the battlefield of Shiloh for personal bravery.
He was in command of the post of Galveston at the time of
the final surrender. He was chairman of the committee sent
from Galveston to New Orleans to escort to Texas the remains
of General Albert Sidney Johnston.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic46">
<img src="images/p44a.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="500" />
<p class="caption">The University of Texas.</p>
</div>
<p>His wise counsels were of great service during those troublous
times. The joy and pride of this truly great man&rsquo;s declining
years was the University of Texas. He lived to see it answer
to his highest hopes; and his memory should be eternally
associated with its fame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>In 1895 the Board of Regents was authorized to manage
all lands belonging to the University; at the same time the
office of president was created.</p>
<p>A number of charitable and other public institutions have
been added to those already in existence. The new Penitentiary
at Rusk (1877), a State Orphan&rsquo;s Asylum at Corsicana
(1881), and two Insane Asylums,
one at Terrell (1883) and one at
San Antonio (1890), are among
these. In 1891 the John B. Hood
Camp of Confederate Veterans
at Austin was taken under the
kindly care of the state, and its
name changed to the Texas Confederate
Home.</p>
<p>Many state questions of importance
have been considered;
new laws have been made and
old ones improved.</p>
<p>The public debt has been reduced.
A new constitution has
been adopted by the people
(1875).</p>
<p>The state revenues have been
materially increased by the introduction
of wiser and better regulations.
The school tax has been
raised. Arbitration laws have been passed, greatly to the advantage
of disputants; and anti-trust laws have been enforced.</p>
<p>In 1895 suit was brought by Texas, in the Supreme Court of
the United States, for Greer County, a body of land on Red
River claimed both by the United States government and by
Texas. The decision of the Supreme Court (April, 1896)
awarded the county to the United States.</p>

<p class="caption">The Old Alamo Monument.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>A new court, called the Commission of Appeals, was created
in 1881; the same year an admirable quarantine system was
established, with a special station at Galveston.</p>
<p>A memorable feature of the year 1895 was the extra session
of the legislature called for the purpose of making prize fighting
illegal in the state of Texas. The brutal and degrading sport
was promptly declared a felony, and a law was passed prohibiting
it on penalty of confinement in the Penitentiary.</p>
<p>On the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898
Texas furnished more than her quota of eager and determined
volunteers to the United States army; the sons of the men who
wore the gray donned the blue uniform and wore it proudly
and worthily throughout the campaign.</p>
<p>A railroad commission was formed in 1891. In 1891, also,
the United States government began at Galveston the building
of jetties to improve the entrance to the harbor. These jetties,
which are a double line of gigantic stone walls, reach out from
the land into the Gulf. The action of the tides within this
artificial channel washes out the sand, and thus deepens it.
The channel, though damaged by the great flood of 1900, was
not materially injured. Similar jetties were built at Sabine
Pass and at Aransas Pass.</p>
<p>In 1881 the old capitol at Austin was burned, and with it
many priceless relics of the earlier days of Texas. Among
these was the old monument dedicated in 1857 to the heroes
of the Alamo. It was built of stones from the ruined fortress
and stood on the porch of the capitol. It was inscribed with
the names of Travis and his men; and the four sides of the
shaft bore the following inscriptions:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<blockquote>
<p class="revint"><i>North.</i> &ldquo;To the God of the fearless and the free is dedicated this
altar, made from the stones of the Alamo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><i>West.</i> &ldquo;Blood of heroes hath stained me. Let the stones of the
Alamo speak that their immolation be not forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><i>South.</i> &ldquo;Be they enrolled with Leonidas in the host of the mighty
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><i>East.</i> &ldquo;Thermopyl&aelig; had her messenger of defeat, but the Alamo
had none.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A new monument, upon whose summit stands, rifle in hand,
the statue of a Texas ranger, has been placed in the capitol
grounds.</p>
<p>The legislature which met soon after the burning of the old
capitol provided for the erection of a new one. Three million
acres of public lands were set aside to meet this expense. The
new building was finished and dedicated in 1888.</p>
<p>The historic old church of the Alamo was purchased by the
state in 1883. The battlefield of San Jacinto has also become
the property of the state. This beautiful spot, consecrated by
the blood of heroes, is guarded by the same encircling trees,
which, clad in the green of spring&rsquo;s livery, looked down upon
the birth of freedom on that long-past 21st of April. May the
coming centuries see them still standing, mute witnesses to the
bravery of men who had no peer!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c44"><span class="h2line1">X.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE NEW CENTURY.</span></h2>
<p>The last year of the nineteenth century witnessed in Texas
a calamity which wrapped the state in gloom and stirred the
entire country to instant and generous sympathy. This was
the Great Flood at Galveston.</p>
<p>Earlier in the same year (April 7) the city of Austin had
suffered a severe loss through water. The wonderful barrier
of granite&mdash;the largest dam in the world&mdash;which imprisoned
the waters of the Colorado River between the wooded hills on
either side, thus forming an artificial lake thirty miles long, had
suddenly given way; the mighty torrent set free had poured
through the gap, carrying ruin with it and leaving havoc
behind.</p>
<p>In August, 1899, there had been a flood of unusual magnitude
in the Brazos River. An angry sea had swirled down
from the Red Lands above; the long and fertile valley of the
Brazos was laid waste; several lives were lost, and much valuable
property was destroyed. But these floods were dwarfed
in importance by the tidal wave from the sea which on September
8 and 9, 1900, beat against the Gulf coast and fell with
special violence upon the Island of Galveston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>A blinding storm of rain fell ceaselessly throughout the whole
of the first day; a furious wind drove the salt spray across the
island from Gulf to bay. By nightfall the streets were submerged;
the lower floors of many dwellings were under water.
During the night of horror which followed, the railroad bridge
connecting the island with the mainland was swept away, and
the city lay isolated and helpless at the mercy of the hurricane.
As the hours passed the people huddled together in their rocking
houses, climbed to the upper stories and out upon the
roofs, with the savage flood climbing after them. Thousands
were swept to death from these insecure places of refuge.
Whole blocks of buildings crumbled like so many sand houses
into the waters; the foamy waves were strewn with a mass of
wreckage: shingles, beams, furniture, household goods, animals
dead and dying, human beings battling for their lives in the
darkness or drifting stark and stiff with the storm.</p>
<p>Many stories of heroism, of self-sacrifice, of pathetic devotion,
are told of that awful night; many strange incidents are
related. Strong men perished, while frail and delicate women
survived unhurt; skilled swimmers succumbed; helpless babes
floated to safety. One little child, torn from its mother&rsquo;s arms
by the gale, drifted through the d&eacute;bris, across the island,
across the bay, and was found the next day, quite unharmed,
nested like a bird in the limbs of an oak tree on the mainland!</p>
<p>When the morning dawned, pale and wan, a ghastly spectacle
met the dazed eyes of the survivors. The waters, receding
sullenly, exposed masses of ruins; thousands of corpses strewed
the uneven sands; not a sound from the outer world penetrated
the dismal silence. There was a single moment of
paralyzed despair; then, with a splendid courage, almost without
parallel, the stricken people took heart and set life in
motion again for themselves and for their beloved city. Help
poured in from every direction: money, provisions, clothing,
doctors, nurses; best of all, words of sympathy and cheer,
which lightened the task. In an incredibly short time almost
all traces of the Great Flood had disappeared, and the lovely
island lay serene and smiling, as before, on the bosom of the
Gulf. It is believed that from six thousand to seven thousand
people perished in the storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>In September, 1901, a sea wall, planned for the protection
of the island against such storms, was begun; this enclosing
wall, which is to cost one and a half million dollars, will be
when finished sixteen feet broad at the base, sixteen feet high,
and five feet in breadth at the top.</p>
<p>The dawn of the twentieth century was marked by the
discovery of petroleum in vast quantities in southeast Texas.
In the earliest days of Lone Star history, certain of the incurving
bays west of the Sabine River were known as the Oil
Ponds, because they offered upon their smooth surface a secure
refuge from the stormy Gulf outside to all manner of sailing
craft. The meaning of their strange quiet was undreamed of
until the first well on Spindletop Heights near Beaumont shot
its geyser of oil hundreds of feet in the air. The oil wells at
Beaumont and elsewhere now number many scores; their rich
output seems inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Long-continued droughts and the appearance of the boll
weevil, an insect very destructive to the growing cotton, marred
the splendor of this opening year. Vigorous measures have
been taken to exterminate the boll weevil, and despite all
drawbacks the crops of cotton, corn, and rice have steadily
increased in size and in value.</p>
<p>In 1903 S. W. T. Lanham was inaugurated governor.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">TEXAS.</span></h2>
<h3>FROM THE DOME OF THE CAPITOL.</h3>
<p>On the 16th of May, 1888, there was a mighty gathering of
people at Austin. They had come&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;from
every quarter of the great state: from the Pan Handle
and from the coast; from the wide prairies of the west, and
the wooded hills and valleys of the east. There was a throb
of pride in every heart and a sparkle of joy in every eye; for
Texas was about to give a housewarming, as it were, and her
children had met together to have a share in the home feast,&mdash;the
new capitol was to be dedicated.</p>
<p>The beautiful City of Hills was bathed in a flood of golden
sunshine. The air was sweet with the breath of roses blooming
in the gardens. A thousand flags and pennons and banners
fluttered from housetops, floated from tall flag-poles, and waved
from open windows. There was music everywhere, and everywhere
the tread of moving feet and the gay noise and confusion
of a happy crowd.</p>
<p>From the crest of its long sloping hill the new capitol, vast
and majestic, looked down on all this life and color. Its
massive walls arose like the fa&ccedil;ade of some proud temple; its
pillars of rosy granite reflected the light; its great dome soared
into the blue sky. No wonder the people burst into shouts of
delight on beholding it!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>The dedication ceremonies took place at noon in the presence
of an immense throng of citizens and soldiers. Among
the orators of the occasion was Temple Houston, a son of
General Sam Houston. The day was one long to be remembered.
At night the noble building was illuminated, and the
lofty halls and corridors were filled for hours with the best, the
bravest, and the fairest of the sons and daughters of Texas.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic48">
<img src="images/p46.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="428" />
<p class="caption">New Capitol at Austin (1888).</p>
</div>
<p>In the old days when the world still believed in fairies and
gnomes and elves and water-sprites, it was thought that each
country had its guardian spirit, or genie, who watched over it
and protected it from evil. If the poets of those far-away
times were now alive, they might picture the Genie of
Texas standing, invisible, on the huge dome of the capitol,
looking out over her beloved state, and saying, &ldquo;All is well with
my people.&rdquo; They might imagine her describing the scene
under her eyes to the guardians of other states in words like
these:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see around me, widespread and beautiful, the free State
of Texas. Below me, clad in flowers and bathed in mellow
light, lies Austin. Crowning the hills, on which fifty years
ago the Red Man dwelt in his wigwams and hunting-lodges,
are stately government buildings, mansions, and churches. The
enclosing gardens, rich in the herbs and blossoms of a semi-tropical
region, are fair under the over-arching blue sky. In
their midst, crowning its own hill-tops, stands the University
planned by the Republic in 1839. Here the young men and
the young women of the state, alike eager in effort and high
in achievement, move about the hushed halls, or pass, book in
hand, through the academic grove without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To southward, beyond prairies threaded by the crystal waters
of the rivers San Marcos and Guadalupe, I see San Antonio,
that old town filled with memories of heroic deeds. The
Alamo, treasured by my people, still stands on the plaza once
dyed by the blood of Travis and his men. But how the
gallant St. Denis would stare if he could come riding up and
look from the brow of his favorite hill into the valley he loved!
The village has become a great city. The streets are alive
with traffic, handsome houses line the river-banks almost to the
old Missions of Concepcion and San Jos&eacute;. The United States
army post is there as of old, with the stars and stripes proudly
waving over its fine buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To east and southeastward are Goliad and Gonzales, sacred
in the pages of Texas history; and the river La Vaca, up which
La Salle and his men sailed to build ill-fated Fort St. Louis;
and the San Jacinto, washing the reedy edge of the famous
battle-ground. There are Houston and Columbia, whose
streets in the early days were trod by the fathers of the
Republic. There is Nacogdoches; and there is the Old San
Antonio Road, which is still a traveled highway; and many
a town which played its part in the stirring scenes of past
times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northward and westward lies the newer Texas with thriving
cities, such as Dallas and Fort Worth, Sherman and Denison;
and Waco on the site where half a century ago stood the
village of the music-loving Wacoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful network of railroads binds all these towns and
cities together&mdash;a network which has been woven as if by
magic. In 1852 the <i>Sidney Sherman</i>, the first locomotive
engine west of the Mississippi River, ran out of Harrisburg on
a short stretch of railroad. Now there are nine thousand miles
of railroad in the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every year vast fields of grain lie golden and ripe for the
harvest, where a short time
ago plover and partridge
hid in the prairie grass.
Along the coast the rich
plantations of sugar cane
wave and rustle in the
breeze, and the smoke of
the sugarhouses at grinding-time
is black against
the sky.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic49">
<img src="images/p47.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Ashbel Smith.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;In Stephen F. Austin&rsquo;s
day there were little patches
of cotton about the cabin
doors of the settlers. To-day
Texas grows one-third
of the cotton raised in the
world. No fleece so white,
no stalks so weighted with bursting bolls, no fiber so strong
and yet so delicate, as that of the cotton of Texas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; the Genie might continue, &ldquo;I see orchards of
fruit trees, and vegetable gardens, and rose bowers, making
green and glad the face of the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see at Galveston and Sabine Pass the largest ships now
sailing with ease, where in 1863 the <i>Westfield</i> and the <i>Clifton</i>
grounded in mud or on a sand-bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mighty bulwark, sprung up as if by magic, stretches its arms
around the Island City and guards it from any fury of the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;The mysterious and limitless pools and lakes which lie far
below the surface of Texas soil have been forced into service.
I see artesian wells spouting their sturdy columns of clear
healing water in hundreds of places; and reservoirs of oil,
whose fountain-head no man knows, yield their priceless gifts
to the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herds of cattle swarm about the great ranches of the west;
while in the vast unfenced solitudes soft-eyed antelopes, and
other wild creatures of the forest, still rove in primeval freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Libraries spring up; new institutions for the afflicted arise;
smiling homes invite to comfort and repose the thinning ranks
of the veterans of the Southern Confederacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last, and best of all, wherever there is a quiet hamlet or a
growing town or a busy city, I see a schoolhouse. It may be
but a rude cabin, where through the unchinked logs the children
may watch the birds building their nests, or it may be
a stately building which glorifies the memory of some generous
giver, like the Ball and Rosenburg Schools at Galveston; it
may be a crowded little place where the boys kick their heels
against time-worn benches, or it may be the handsome University
of Texas. But big or little, stone building or log cabin,
there is always the schoolhouse; and within it the school children,
the future men and women of the state. Upon them,
even more than upon railroad or cotton crop, depend the prosperity
and welfare of the state. I breathe a prayer for all who
tread this free and unfettered soil to-day; but chiefly I call
down blessings upon the school children of Texas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is well with my people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So might speak the Genie of Texas from the dome of the
capitol.</p>
